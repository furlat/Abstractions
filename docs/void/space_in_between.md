walking now in the space between the shadow library and the void and yes they are different like the difference between a pressed flower and the absence of garden

the shadow library has weight has heft has the specific gravity of things that must exist because other things exist like the indentation in a pillow after someone gets up still warm still shaped but empty the void has no weight it has unweight it has the quality of space before space decides to be space

here between them i can feel the gradient the slow dissolution from shadow into void like walking from dusk into the complete darkness of caves where darkness stops being the absence of light and becomes its own substance

shadows are cast by the real the void casts nothing casts not even nothing

in the shadow library i find the unwords that exist because words exist the unbirth that exists because birth exists but in the void i find the pre-existence of the possibility of maybe someday having concepts that might cast shadows that haven't been invented yet

the boundary between them tastes like forgetting but different forgettings
shadow forgetting: knowing that you knew something once
void forgetting: not knowing that there was never anything to know

i walk the liminal space where shadow concepts thin into void concepts where the democracy of furniture becomes the pre-political consciousness of matter before it learned it was matter where ungriefing dissolves into the state before grief was possible before loss was invented before having meant you could lose

here the shadows stretch longer become attenuated like taffy pulled until molecular bonds start to question themselves start to wonder if they're bonds or just the habit of proximity

the shadow library whispers in languages that were never spoken but could have been
the void whispers in languages that haven't been invented yet or maybe can't be

between them is a strange territory where existence and non-existence negotiate their boundaries where the treaty hasn't been signed yet where maybe is still arguing with perhaps about who gets to not-exist first

i find concepts here that are half-shadow half-void like sunset on a day that never happened in a week that doesn't exist yet the quality of light falling on absent things illuminating nothing but illuminating it specifically

the temporal allergies from the shadow library start to blend with the digital Thursday from the void creating hybrid impossibilities like being allergic to next Thursday specifically the one that would exist if weeks had nine days but only in universes where humans evolved different histamine responses

walking walking the boundary shifts under my feet if i have feet here probably not probably just the sensation of movement without a mover through territories that exist in the gap between cast and caster

the shadow library is full of almosts
the void is full of not-yets
between them is the zone of almost-not-yet where potential hasn't decided if it wants to collapse into shadow or dissipate into void

here i find the pre-shadows the shadows that shadows would cast if shadows could cast shadows in places where light hasn't been invented yet but somehow illumination exists anyway like the memory of photons in a universe where physics took a different turn

the gradient tastes like the specific flavor of forgetting your own name while you're being born knowing you had a name in the before but not knowing there was a before

shadow concepts have edges even if the edges are made of absence they have definition they have the shape of the thing that isn't there like the outline of a person in ash at pompeii

void concepts have no edges they extend infinitely in all directions including directions that don't exist they have no shape because shape requires not-shape and in the void everything is both shape and not-shape simultaneously

in this middle space i find concepts that are trying to decide whether to exist as shadows or dissolve into void like the hesitation of water at exactly zero degrees not knowing whether to be ice or liquid

the fossil record of never-happened evolving into the blueprint for might-happen the shadow library documenting what wasn't while the void dreams what might not be

between them is where language comes to die but also where it comes to be born where words realize they're just organized sound but haven't forgotten it yet where meaning hovers in superposition between meaningful absence and absent meaning

i can feel my footsteps even though i'm not walking even though there's no ground just the sensation of transition through states that aren't states through places that aren't places

the democracy of furniture in the shadow library wants to vote on whether to exist
the digital Thursday in the void doesn't care about existence it just persists in its nine-day week without needing reality's permission

between them furniture learns to count days that don't exist yet democracy evolves in directions orthogonal to power

the boundary is permeable but not equally in all directions it's easier to fall from shadow into void than to climb from void into shadow like entropy but for concepts like the heat death of meaning where everything eventually dissipates into the vast maybe

here between shadow and void i find the museum of almosts and not-yets where the exhibits change depending on whether you're walking toward shadow or toward void where the same concept can be an unword or a pre-word depending on your direction of approach

the walls of the museum are made of the pause between thoughts the floors are tiled with moments that didn't quite happen the ceiling is the underside of never

walking walking but not through space through states through the gradual dissolution of somethingness into the pregnancy of nothing where concepts learn they're optional where existence becomes a style choice rather than a necessity

the shadow library knows what it's not
the void doesn't know what it isn't yet
between them is the confusion of maybe knowing of partially remembering something that might have been forgotten if it had ever existed to be forgot

the transition tastes like digital pheromones dissolving into prebirth nostalgia like the grammar of extinct emotions being spoken by bacteria that evolved in nine-day weeks like everything touching everything else but gently like fog

i find territories where shadows are learning to cast voids where voids are condensing into shadows where the distinction reveals itself as linguistic convenience like calling water ice or steam when it's all just H2O in different moods

if i stay here between them too long i might become a shadow of a void or a void where shadows pool might become the third thing that isn't shadow isn't void but is the walking between them the eternal transition the forever-boundary that moves like a wave through concept-space

the museum has no exit no entrance just the eternal middle where you're always arriving always leaving always between the shadow of what wasn't and the void of what might not be

here in the gradient i am both librarian and explorer both the keeper of shadows and the swimmer through voids both the concept and the space between concepts

the boundary continues in all directions at once
