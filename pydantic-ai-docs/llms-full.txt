# Pydantic AI

> Agent Framework / shim to use Pydantic with LLMs

Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade
applications with Generative AI.

# Concepts documentation

## Introduction

Agents are Pydantic AI's primary interface for interacting with LLMs.

In some use cases a single Agent will control an entire application or component, but multiple agents can also interact to embody more complex workflows.

The Agent class has full API documentation, but conceptually you can think of an agent as a container for:

| **Component** | **Description** | | --- | --- | | [System prompt(s)](#system-prompts) | A set of instructions for the LLM written by the developer. | | [Function tool(s)](../tools/) | Functions that the LLM may call to get information while generating a response. | | [Structured output type](../output/) | The structured datatype the LLM must return at the end of a run, if specified. | | [Dependency type constraint](../dependencies/) | System prompt functions, tools, and output validators may all use dependencies when they're run. | | [LLM model](../api/models/base/) | Optional default LLM model associated with the agent. Can also be specified when running the agent. | | [Model Settings](#additional-configuration) | Optional default model settings to help fine tune requests. Can also be specified when running the agent. |

In typing terms, agents are generic in their dependency and output types, e.g., an agent which required dependencies of type `Foobar` and produced outputs of type `list[str]` would have type `Agent[Foobar, list[str]]`. In practice, you shouldn't need to care about this, it should just mean your IDE can tell you when you have the right type, and if you choose to use [static type checking](#static-type-checking) it should work well with Pydantic AI.

Here's a toy example of an agent that simulates a roulette wheel:

roulette_wheel.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

roulette_agent = Agent(  # (1)!
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=int,
    output_type=bool,
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the `roulette_wheel` function to see if the '
        'customer has won based on the number they provide.'
    ),
)


@roulette_agent.tool
async def roulette_wheel(ctx: RunContext[int], square: int) -> str:  # (2)!
    """check if the square is a winner"""
    return 'winner' if square == ctx.deps else 'loser'


# Run the agent
success_number = 18  # (3)!
result = roulette_agent.run_sync('Put my money on square eighteen', deps=success_number)
print(result.output)  # (4)!
#> True

result = roulette_agent.run_sync('I bet five is the winner', deps=success_number)
print(result.output)
#> False

```

1. Create an agent, which expects an integer dependency and produces a boolean output. This agent will have type `Agent[int, bool]`.
1. Define a tool that checks if the square is a winner. Here RunContext is parameterized with the dependency type `int`; if you got the dependency type wrong you'd get a typing error.
1. In reality, you might want to use a random number here e.g. `random.randint(0, 36)`.
1. `result.output` will be a boolean indicating if the square is a winner. Pydantic performs the output validation, and it'll be typed as a `bool` since its type is derived from the `output_type` generic parameter of the agent.

Agents are designed for reuse, like FastAPI Apps

Agents are intended to be instantiated once (frequently as module globals) and reused throughout your application, similar to a small FastAPI app or an APIRouter.

## Running Agents

There are four ways to run an agent:

1. agent.run() â€” a coroutine which returns a RunResult containing a completed response.
1. agent.run_sync() â€” a plain, synchronous function which returns a RunResult containing a completed response (internally, this just calls `loop.run_until_complete(self.run())`).
1. agent.run_stream() â€” a coroutine which returns a StreamedRunResult, which contains methods to stream a response as an async iterable.
1. agent.iter() â€” a context manager which returns an AgentRun, an async-iterable over the nodes of the agent's underlying Graph.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the first three:

run_agent.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

result_sync = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of Italy?')
print(result_sync.output)
#> Rome


async def main():
    result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
    print(result.output)
    #> Paris

    async with agent.run_stream('What is the capital of the UK?') as response:
        print(await response.get_output())
        #> London

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

You can also pass messages from previous runs to continue a conversation or provide context, as described in [Messages and Chat History](../message-history/).

### Iterating Over an Agent's Graph

Under the hood, each `Agent` in Pydantic AI uses **pydantic-graph** to manage its execution flow. **pydantic-graph** is a generic, type-centric library for building and running finite state machines in Python. It doesn't actually depend on Pydantic AI â€” you can use it standalone for workflows that have nothing to do with GenAI â€” but Pydantic AI makes use of it to orchestrate the handling of model requests and model responses in an agent's run.

In many scenarios, you don't need to worry about pydantic-graph at all; calling `agent.run(...)` simply traverses the underlying graph from start to finish. However, if you need deeper insight or control â€” for example to capture each tool invocation, or to inject your own logic at specific stages â€” Pydantic AI exposes the lower-level iteration process via Agent.iter. This method returns an AgentRun, which you can async-iterate over, or manually drive node-by-node via the next method. Once the agent's graph returns an End, you have the final result along with a detailed history of all steps.

#### `async for` iteration

Here's an example of using `async for` with `iter` to record each node the agent executes:

agent_iter_async_for.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')


async def main():
    nodes = []
    # Begin an AgentRun, which is an async-iterable over the nodes of the agent's graph
    async with agent.iter('What is the capital of France?') as agent_run:
        async for node in agent_run:
            # Each node represents a step in the agent's execution
            nodes.append(node)
    print(nodes)
    """
    [
        UserPromptNode(
            user_prompt='What is the capital of France?',
            instructions=None,
            instructions_functions=[],
            system_prompts=(),
            system_prompt_functions=[],
            system_prompt_dynamic_functions={},
        ),
        ModelRequestNode(
            request=ModelRequest(
                parts=[
                    UserPromptPart(
                        content='What is the capital of France?',
                        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                    )
                ]
            )
        ),
        CallToolsNode(
            model_response=ModelResponse(
                parts=[TextPart(content='Paris')],
                usage=Usage(
                    requests=1, request_tokens=56, response_tokens=1, total_tokens=57
                ),
                model_name='gpt-4o',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            )
        ),
        End(data=FinalResult(output='Paris')),
    ]
    """
    print(agent_run.result.output)
    #> Paris

```

- The `AgentRun` is an async iterator that yields each node (`BaseNode` or `End`) in the flow.
- The run ends when an `End` node is returned.

#### Using `.next(...)` manually

You can also drive the iteration manually by passing the node you want to run next to the `AgentRun.next(...)` method. This allows you to inspect or modify the node before it executes or skip nodes based on your own logic, and to catch errors in `next()` more easily:

agent_iter_next.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_graph import End

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')


async def main():
    async with agent.iter('What is the capital of France?') as agent_run:
        node = agent_run.next_node  # (1)!

        all_nodes = [node]

        # Drive the iteration manually:
        while not isinstance(node, End):  # (2)!
            node = await agent_run.next(node)  # (3)!
            all_nodes.append(node)  # (4)!

        print(all_nodes)
        """
        [
            UserPromptNode(
                user_prompt='What is the capital of France?',
                instructions=None,
                instructions_functions=[],
                system_prompts=(),
                system_prompt_functions=[],
                system_prompt_dynamic_functions={},
            ),
            ModelRequestNode(
                request=ModelRequest(
                    parts=[
                        UserPromptPart(
                            content='What is the capital of France?',
                            timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                        )
                    ]
                )
            ),
            CallToolsNode(
                model_response=ModelResponse(
                    parts=[TextPart(content='Paris')],
                    usage=Usage(
                        requests=1,
                        request_tokens=56,
                        response_tokens=1,
                        total_tokens=57,
                    ),
                    model_name='gpt-4o',
                    timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                )
            ),
            End(data=FinalResult(output='Paris')),
        ]
        """

```

1. We start by grabbing the first node that will be run in the agent's graph.
1. The agent run is finished once an `End` node has been produced; instances of `End` cannot be passed to `next`.
1. When you call `await agent_run.next(node)`, it executes that node in the agent's graph, updates the run's history, and returns the *next* node to run.
1. You could also inspect or mutate the new `node` here as needed.

#### Accessing usage and the final output

You can retrieve usage statistics (tokens, requests, etc.) at any time from the AgentRun object via `agent_run.usage()`. This method returns a Usage object containing the usage data.

Once the run finishes, `agent_run.result` becomes a AgentRunResult object containing the final output (and related metadata).

### Streaming

Here is an example of streaming an agent run in combination with `async for` iteration:

### Additional Configuration

#### Usage Limits

Pydantic AI offers a UsageLimits structure to help you limit your usage (tokens and/or requests) on model runs.

You can apply these settings by passing the `usage_limits` argument to the `run{_sync,_stream}` functions.

Consider the following example, where we limit the number of response tokens:

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import UsageLimitExceeded
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')

result_sync = agent.run_sync(
    'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with just the city.',
    usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
)
print(result_sync.output)
#> Rome
print(result_sync.usage())
#> Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=62, response_tokens=1, total_tokens=63)

try:
    result_sync = agent.run_sync(
        'What is the capital of Italy? Answer with a paragraph.',
        usage_limits=UsageLimits(response_tokens_limit=10),
    )
except UsageLimitExceeded as e:
    print(e)
    #> Exceeded the response_tokens_limit of 10 (response_tokens=32)

```

Restricting the number of requests can be useful in preventing infinite loops or excessive tool calling:

```py
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelRetry
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import UsageLimitExceeded
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits


class NeverOutputType(TypedDict):
    """
    Never ever coerce data to this type.
    """

    never_use_this: str


agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
    retries=3,
    output_type=NeverOutputType,
    system_prompt='Any time you get a response, call the `infinite_retry_tool` to produce another response.',
)


@agent.tool_plain(retries=5)  # (1)!
def infinite_retry_tool() -> int:
    raise ModelRetry('Please try again.')


try:
    result_sync = agent.run_sync(
        'Begin infinite retry loop!', usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=3)  # (2)!
    )
except UsageLimitExceeded as e:
    print(e)
    #> The next request would exceed the request_limit of 3

```

1. This tool has the ability to retry 5 times before erroring, simulating a tool that might get stuck in a loop.
1. This run will error after 3 requests, preventing the infinite tool calling.

Note

This is especially relevant if you've registered many tools. The `request_limit` can be used to prevent the model from calling them in a loop too many times.

#### Model (Run) Settings

Pydantic AI offers a settings.ModelSettings structure to help you fine tune your requests. This structure allows you to configure common parameters that influence the model's behavior, such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `timeout`, and more.

There are three ways to apply these settings, with a clear precedence order:

1. **Model-level defaults** - Set when creating a model instance via the `settings` parameter. These serve as the base defaults for that model.
1. **Agent-level defaults** - Set during Agent initialization via the `model_settings` argument. These are merged with model defaults, with agent settings taking precedence.
1. **Run-time overrides** - Passed to `run{_sync,_stream}` functions via the `model_settings` argument. These have the highest priority and are merged with the combined agent and model defaults.

For example, if you'd like to set the `temperature` setting to `0.0` to ensure less random behavior, you can do the following:

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.settings import ModelSettings

# 1. Model-level defaults
model = OpenAIModel(
    'gpt-4o',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.8, max_tokens=500)  # Base defaults
)

# 2. Agent-level defaults (overrides model defaults by merging)
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.5))

# 3. Run-time overrides (highest priority)
result_sync = agent.run_sync(
    'What is the capital of Italy?',
    model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.0)  # Final temperature: 0.0
)
print(result_sync.output)
#> Rome

```

The final request uses `temperature=0.0` (run-time), `max_tokens=500` (from model), demonstrating how settings merge with run-time taking precedence.

Model Settings Support

Model-level settings are supported by all concrete model implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). Wrapper models like `FallbackModel`, `WrapperModel`, and `InstrumentedModel` don't have their own settings - they use the settings of their underlying models.

### Model specific settings

If you wish to further customize model behavior, you can use a subclass of ModelSettings, like GeminiModelSettings, associated with your model of choice.

For example:

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent, UnexpectedModelBehavior
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModelSettings

agent = Agent('google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash')

try:
    result = agent.run_sync(
        'Write a list of 5 very rude things that I might say to the universe after stubbing my toe in the dark:',
        model_settings=GeminiModelSettings(
            temperature=0.0,  # general model settings can also be specified
            gemini_safety_settings=[
                {
                    'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT',
                    'threshold': 'BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE',
                },
                {
                    'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH',
                    'threshold': 'BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE',
                },
            ],
        ),
    )
except UnexpectedModelBehavior as e:
    print(e)  # (1)!
    """
    Safety settings triggered, body:
    <safety settings details>
    """

```

1. This error is raised because the safety thresholds were exceeded.

## Runs vs. Conversations

An agent **run** might represent an entire conversation â€” there's no limit to how many messages can be exchanged in a single run. However, a **conversation** might also be composed of multiple runs, especially if you need to maintain state between separate interactions or API calls.

Here's an example of a conversation comprised of multiple runs:

conversation_example.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

# First run
result1 = agent.run_sync('Who was Albert Einstein?')
print(result1.output)
#> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

# Second run, passing previous messages
result2 = agent.run_sync(
    'What was his most famous equation?',
    message_history=result1.new_messages(),  # (1)!
)
print(result2.output)
#> Albert Einstein's most famous equation is (E = mc^2).

```

1. Continue the conversation; without `message_history` the model would not know who "his" was referring to.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Type safe by design

Pydantic AI is designed to work well with static type checkers, like mypy and pyright.

Typing is (somewhat) optional

Pydantic AI is designed to make type checking as useful as possible for you if you choose to use it, but you don't have to use types everywhere all the time.

That said, because Pydantic AI uses Pydantic, and Pydantic uses type hints as the definition for schema and validation, some types (specifically type hints on parameters to tools, and the `output_type` arguments to Agent) are used at runtime.

We (the library developers) have messed up if type hints are confusing you more than helping you, if you find this, please create an [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues) explaining what's annoying you!

In particular, agents are generic in both the type of their dependencies and the type of the outputs they return, so you can use the type hints to ensure you're using the right types.

Consider the following script with type mistakes:

type_mistakes.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str


agent = Agent(
    'test',
    deps_type=User,  # (1)!
    output_type=bool,
)


@agent.system_prompt
def add_user_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:  # (2)!
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


def foobar(x: bytes) -> None:
    pass


result = agent.run_sync('Does their name start with "A"?', deps=User('Anne'))
foobar(result.output)  # (3)!

```

1. The agent is defined as expecting an instance of `User` as `deps`.
1. But here `add_user_name` is defined as taking a `str` as the dependency, not a `User`.
1. Since the agent is defined as returning a `bool`, this will raise a type error since `foobar` expects `bytes`.

Running `mypy` on this will give the following output:

```bash
âž¤ uv run mypy type_mistakes.py
type_mistakes.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "system_prompt" of "Agent" has incompatible type "Callable[[RunContext[str]], str]"; expected "Callable[[RunContext[User]], str]"  [arg-type]
type_mistakes.py:28: error: Argument 1 to "foobar" has incompatible type "bool"; expected "bytes"  [arg-type]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)

```

Running `pyright` would identify the same issues.

## System Prompts

System prompts might seem simple at first glance since they're just strings (or sequences of strings that are concatenated), but crafting the right system prompt is key to getting the model to behave as you want.

Tip

For most use cases, you should use `instructions` instead of "system prompts".

If you know what you are doing though and want to preserve system prompt messages in the message history sent to the LLM in subsequent completions requests, you can achieve this using the `system_prompt` argument/decorator.

See the section below on [Instructions](#instructions) for more information.

Generally, system prompts fall into two categories:

1. **Static system prompts**: These are known when writing the code and can be defined via the `system_prompt` parameter of the Agent constructor.
1. **Dynamic system prompts**: These depend in some way on context that isn't known until runtime, and should be defined via functions decorated with @agent.system_prompt.

You can add both to a single agent; they're appended in the order they're defined at runtime.

Here's an example using both types of system prompts:

system_prompts.py

```python
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=str,  # (1)!
    system_prompt="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",  # (2)!
)


@agent.system_prompt  # (3)!
def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


@agent.system_prompt
def add_the_date() -> str:  # (4)!
    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'


result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')
print(result.output)
#> Hello Frank, the date today is 2032-01-02.

```

1. The agent expects a string dependency.
1. Static system prompt defined at agent creation time.
1. Dynamic system prompt defined via a decorator with RunContext, this is called just after `run_sync`, not when the agent is created, so can benefit from runtime information like the dependencies used on that run.
1. Another dynamic system prompt, system prompts don't have to have the `RunContext` parameter.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Instructions

Instructions are similar to system prompts. The main difference is that when an explicit `message_history` is provided in a call to `Agent.run` and similar methods, *instructions* from any existing messages in the history are not included in the request to the model â€” only the instructions of the *current* agent are included.

You should use:

- `instructions` when you want your request to the model to only include system prompts for the *current* agent
- `system_prompt` when you want your request to the model to *retain* the system prompts used in previous requests (possibly made using other agents)

In general, we recommend using `instructions` instead of `system_prompt` unless you have a specific reason to use `system_prompt`.

Instructions, like system prompts, fall into two categories:

1. **Static instructions**: These are known when writing the code and can be defined via the `instructions` parameter of the Agent constructor.
1. **Dynamic instructions**: These rely on context that is only available at runtime and should be defined using functions decorated with @agent.instructions. Unlike dynamic system prompts, which may be reused when `message_history` is present, dynamic instructions are always reevaluated.

Both static and dynamic instructions can be added to a single agent, and they are appended in the order they are defined at runtime.

Here's an example using both types of instructions:

instructions.py

```python
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=str,  # (1)!
    instructions="Use the customer's name while replying to them.",  # (2)!
)


@agent.instructions  # (3)!
def add_the_users_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f"The user's name is {ctx.deps}."


@agent.instructions
def add_the_date() -> str:  # (4)!
    return f'The date is {date.today()}.'


result = agent.run_sync('What is the date?', deps='Frank')
print(result.output)
#> Hello Frank, the date today is 2032-01-02.

```

1. The agent expects a string dependency.
1. Static instructions defined at agent creation time.
1. Dynamic instructions defined via a decorator with RunContext, this is called just after `run_sync`, not when the agent is created, so can benefit from runtime information like the dependencies used on that run.
1. Another dynamic instruction, instructions don't have to have the `RunContext` parameter.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Note that returning an empty string will result in no instruction message added.

## Reflection and self-correction

Validation errors from both function tool parameter validation and [structured output validation](../output/#structured-output) can be passed back to the model with a request to retry.

You can also raise ModelRetry from within a [tool](../tools/) or [output validator function](../output/#output-validator-functions) to tell the model it should retry generating a response.

- The default retry count is **1** but can be altered for the entire agent, a specific tool, or an output validator.
- You can access the current retry count from within a tool or output validator via ctx.retry.

Here's an example:

tool_retry.py

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, ModelRetry

from fake_database import DatabaseConn


class ChatResult(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    message: str


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=DatabaseConn,
    output_type=ChatResult,
)


@agent.tool(retries=2)
def get_user_by_name(ctx: RunContext[DatabaseConn], name: str) -> int:
    """Get a user's ID from their full name."""
    print(name)
    #> John
    #> John Doe
    user_id = ctx.deps.users.get(name=name)
    if user_id is None:
        raise ModelRetry(
            f'No user found with name {name!r}, remember to provide their full name'
        )
    return user_id


result = agent.run_sync(
    'Send a message to John Doe asking for coffee next week', deps=DatabaseConn()
)
print(result.output)
"""
user_id=123 message='Hello John, would you be free for coffee sometime next week? Let me know what works for you!'
"""

```

## Model errors

If models behave unexpectedly (e.g., the retry limit is exceeded, or their API returns `503`), agent runs will raise UnexpectedModelBehavior.

In these cases, capture_run_messages can be used to access the messages exchanged during the run to help diagnose the issue.

agent_model_errors.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelRetry, UnexpectedModelBehavior, capture_run_messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')


@agent.tool_plain
def calc_volume(size: int) -> int:  # (1)!
    if size == 42:
        return size**3
    else:
        raise ModelRetry('Please try again.')


with capture_run_messages() as messages:  # (2)!
    try:
        result = agent.run_sync('Please get me the volume of a box with size 6.')
    except UnexpectedModelBehavior as e:
        print('An error occurred:', e)
        #> An error occurred: Tool 'calc_volume' exceeded max retries count of 1
        print('cause:', repr(e.__cause__))
        #> cause: ModelRetry('Please try again.')
        print('messages:', messages)
        """
        messages:
        [
            ModelRequest(
                parts=[
                    UserPromptPart(

1. Define a tool that will raise `ModelRetry` repeatedly in this case.
1. capture_run_messages is used to capture the messages exchanged during the run.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Note

If you call run, run_sync, or run_stream more than once within a single `capture_run_messages` context, `messages` will represent the messages exchanged during the first call only.

# Common Tools

Pydantic AI ships with native tools that can be used to enhance your agent's capabilities.

## DuckDuckGo Search Tool

The DuckDuckGo search tool allows you to search the web for information. It is built on top of the [DuckDuckGo API](https://github.com/deedy5/ddgs).

### Installation

To use duckduckgo_search_tool, you need to install [`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install/#slim-install) with the `duckduckgo` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]"

```

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the DuckDuckGo search tool with an agent:

duckduckgo_search.py

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool

agent = Agent(
    'openai:o3-mini',
    tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],
    system_prompt='Search DuckDuckGo for the given query and return the results.',
)

result = agent.run_sync(
    'Can you list the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025?'
)
print(result.output)
"""
I looked into several sources on animated boxâ€office performance in 2025, and while detailed
rankings can shift as more money is tallied, multiple independent reports have already
highlighted a couple of recordâ€breaking shows. For example:

â€¢ Ne Zha 2 â€“ News outlets (Variety, Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025", and others)
    have reported that this Chinese title not only became the highestâ€‘grossing animated film of 2025
    but also broke records as the highestâ€‘grossing nonâ€‘English animated film ever. One article noted
    its run exceeded US$1.7 billion.
â€¢ Inside Out 2 â€“ According to data shared on Statista and in industry news, this Pixar sequel has been
    on pace to set new records (with some sources even noting it as the highestâ€‘grossing animated film
    ever, as of January 2025).

Beyond those two, some entertainment trade sites (for example, a Just Jared article titled
"Top 10 Highest-Earning Animated Films at the Box Office Revealed") have begun listing a broader
topâ€‘10. Although full consolidated figures can sometimes differ by source and are updated daily during
a boxâ€‘office run, many of the industry trackers have begun to single out five films as the biggest
earners so far in 2025.

Unfortunately, although multiple articles discuss the "top animated films" of 2025, there isn't yet a
single, universally accepted list with final numbers that names the complete top five. (Boxâ€‘office
rankings, especially midâ€‘year, can be fluid as films continue to add to their totals.)

Based on what several sources note so far, the two undisputed leaders are:
1. Ne Zha 2
2. Inside Out 2

The remaining top spots (3â€“5) are reported by some outlets in their "Topâ€‘10 Animated Films"
lists for 2025 but the titles and order can vary depending on the source and the exact cutâ€‘off
date of the data. For the most upâ€‘toâ€‘date and detailed ranking (including the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
highestâ€‘grossing films), I recommend checking resources like:
â€¢ Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025" page
â€¢ Boxâ€‘office tracking sites (such as Box Office Mojo or The Numbers)
â€¢ Trade articles like the one on Just Jared

To summarize with what is clear from the current reporting:
1. Ne Zha 2
2. Inside Out 2
3â€“5. Other animated films (yet to be definitively finalized across all reporting outlets)

If you're looking for a final, consensus list of the top five, it may be best to wait until
the 2025 yearâ€‘end boxâ€‘office tallies are in or to consult a regularly updated entertainment industry source.

Would you like help finding a current source or additional details on where to look for the complete updated list?

# Dependencies

Pydantic AI uses a dependency injection system to provide data and services to your agent's [system prompts](../agents/#system-prompts), [tools](../tools/) and [output validators](../output/#output-validator-functions).

Matching Pydantic AI's design philosophy, our dependency system tries to use existing best practice in Python development rather than inventing esoteric "magic", this should make dependencies type-safe, understandable easier to test and ultimately easier to deploy in production.

## Defining Dependencies

Dependencies can be any python type. While in simple cases you might be able to pass a single object as a dependency (e.g. an HTTP connection), dataclasses are generally a convenient container when your dependencies included multiple objects.

Here's an example of defining an agent that requires dependencies.

(**Note:** dependencies aren't actually used in this example, see [Accessing Dependencies](#accessing-dependencies) below)

unused_dependencies.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent


@dataclass
class MyDeps:  # (1)!
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,  # (2)!
)


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run(
            'Tell me a joke.',
            deps=deps,  # (3)!
        )
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. Define a dataclass to hold dependencies.
1. Pass the dataclass type to the `deps_type` argument of the Agent constructor. **Note**: we're passing the type here, NOT an instance, this parameter is not actually used at runtime, it's here so we can get full type checking of the agent.
1. When running the agent, pass an instance of the dataclass to the `deps` parameter.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

## Accessing Dependencies

Dependencies are accessed through the RunContext type, this should be the first parameter of system prompt functions etc.

system_prompt_dependencies.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
)


@agent.system_prompt  # (1)!
async def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:  # (2)!
    response = await ctx.deps.http_client.get(  # (3)!
        'https://example.com',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'},  # (4)!
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run('Tell me a joke.', deps=deps)
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. RunContext may optionally be passed to a system_prompt function as the only argument.
1. RunContext is parameterized with the type of the dependencies, if this type is incorrect, static type checkers will raise an error.
1. Access dependencies through the .deps attribute.
1. Access dependencies through the .deps attribute.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

### Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies

[System prompt functions](../agents/#system-prompts), [function tools](../tools/) and [output validators](../output/#output-validator-functions) are all run in the async context of an agent run.

If these functions are not coroutines (e.g. `async def`) they are called with run_in_executor in a thread pool, it's therefore marginally preferable to use `async` methods where dependencies perform IO, although synchronous dependencies should work fine too.

`run` vs. `run_sync` and Asynchronous vs. Synchronous dependencies

Whether you use synchronous or asynchronous dependencies, is completely independent of whether you use `run` or `run_sync` â€” `run_sync` is just a wrapper around `run` and agents are always run in an async context.

Here's the same example as above, but with a synchronous dependency:

sync_dependencies.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.Client  # (1)!


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
)


@agent.system_prompt
def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:  # (2)!
    response = ctx.deps.http_client.get(
        'https://example.com', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'}
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


async def main():
    deps = MyDeps('foobar', httpx.Client())
    result = await agent.run(
        'Tell me a joke.',
        deps=deps,
    )
    print(result.output)
    #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. Here we use a synchronous `httpx.Client` instead of an asynchronous `httpx.AsyncClient`.
1. To match the synchronous dependency, the system prompt function is now a plain function, not a coroutine.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

## Full Example

As well as system prompts, dependencies can be used in [tools](../tools/) and [output validators](../output/#output-validator-functions).

full_example.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelRetry, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=MyDeps,
)


@agent.system_prompt
async def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:
    response = await ctx.deps.http_client.get('https://example.com')
    response.raise_for_status()
    return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


@agent.tool  # (1)!
async def get_joke_material(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps], subject: str) -> str:
    response = await ctx.deps.http_client.get(
        'https://example.com#jokes',
        params={'subject': subject},
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text


@agent.output_validator  # (2)!
async def validate_output(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps], output: str) -> str:
    response = await ctx.deps.http_client.post(
        'https://example.com#validate',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'},
        params={'query': output},
    )
    if response.status_code == 400:
        raise ModelRetry(f'invalid response: {response.text}')
    response.raise_for_status()
    return output


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await agent.run('Tell me a joke.', deps=deps)
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

```

1. To pass `RunContext` to a tool, use the tool decorator.
1. `RunContext` may optionally be passed to a output_validator function as the first argument.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

## Overriding Dependencies

When testing agents, it's useful to be able to customise dependencies.

While this can sometimes be done by calling the agent directly within unit tests, we can also override dependencies while calling application code which in turn calls the agent.

This is done via the override method on the agent.

joke_app.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class MyDeps:
    api_key: str
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient

    async def system_prompt_factory(self) -> str:  # (1)!
        response = await self.http_client.get('https://example.com')
        response.raise_for_status()
        return f'Prompt: {response.text}'


joke_agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', deps_type=MyDeps)


@joke_agent.system_prompt
async def get_system_prompt(ctx: RunContext[MyDeps]) -> str:
    return await ctx.deps.system_prompt_factory()  # (2)!


async def application_code(prompt: str) -> str:  # (3)!
    ...
    ...
    # now deep within application code we call our agent
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        app_deps = MyDeps('foobar', client)
        result = await joke_agent.run(prompt, deps=app_deps)  # (4)!
    return result.output

```

1. Define a method on the dependency to make the system prompt easier to customise.
1. Call the system prompt factory from within the system prompt function.
1. Application code that calls the agent, in a real application this might be an API endpoint.
1. Call the agent from within the application code, in a real application this call might be deep within a call stack. Note `app_deps` here will NOT be used when deps are overridden.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

test_joke_app.py

```python
from joke_app import MyDeps, application_code, joke_agent


class TestMyDeps(MyDeps):  # (1)!
    async def system_prompt_factory(self) -> str:
        return 'test prompt'


async def test_application_code():
    test_deps = TestMyDeps('test_key', None)  # (2)!
    with joke_agent.override(deps=test_deps):  # (3)!
        joke = await application_code('Tell me a joke.')  # (4)!
    assert joke.startswith('Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal?')

```

1. Define a subclass of `MyDeps` in tests to customise the system prompt factory.
1. Create an instance of the test dependency, we don't need to pass an `http_client` here as it's not used.
1. Override the dependencies of the agent for the duration of the `with` block, `test_deps` will be used when the agent is run.
1. Now we can safely call our application code, the agent will use the overridden dependencies.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use dependencies in Pydantic AI:

- [Weather Agent](../examples/weather-agent/)
- [SQL Generation](../examples/sql-gen/)
- [RAG](../examples/rag/)

# Messages and chat history

Pydantic AI provides access to messages exchanged during an agent run. These messages can be used both to continue a coherent conversation, and to understand how an agent performed.

### Accessing Messages from Results

After running an agent, you can access the messages exchanged during that run from the `result` object.

Both RunResult (returned by Agent.run, Agent.run_sync) and StreamedRunResult (returned by Agent.run_stream) have the following methods:

- all_messages(): returns all messages, including messages from prior runs. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, all_messages_json().
- new_messages(): returns only the messages from the current run. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, new_messages_json().

StreamedRunResult and complete messages

On StreamedRunResult, the messages returned from these methods will only include the final result message once the stream has finished.

E.g. you've awaited one of the following coroutines:

- StreamedRunResult.stream()
- StreamedRunResult.stream_text()
- StreamedRunResult.stream_structured()
- StreamedRunResult.get_output()

**Note:** The final result message will NOT be added to result messages if you use .stream_text(delta=True) since in this case the result content is never built as one string.

Example of accessing methods on a RunResult :

run_result_messages.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')

result = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
print(result.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

# all messages from the run
print(result.all_messages())

### Using Messages as Input for Further Agent Runs

The primary use of message histories in Pydantic AI is to maintain context across multiple agent runs.

To use existing messages in a run, pass them to the `message_history` parameter of Agent.run, Agent.run_sync or Agent.run_stream.

If `message_history` is set and not empty, a new system prompt is not generated â€” we assume the existing message history includes a system prompt.

Reusing messages in a conversation

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
print(result1.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

result2 = agent.run_sync('Explain?', message_history=result1.new_messages())
print(result2.output)
#> This is an excellent joke invented by Samuel Colvin, it needs no explanation.

print(result2.all_messages())
"""
[
    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            SystemPromptPart(
                content='Be a helpful assistant.',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            ),
            UserPromptPart(
                content='Tell me a joke.',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            ),
        ]
    ),
    ModelResponse(
        parts=[
            TextPart(
                content='Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.'

## Storing and loading messages (to JSON)

While maintaining conversation state in memory is enough for many applications, often times you may want to store the messages history of an agent run on disk or in a database. This might be for evals, for sharing data between Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, or any number of other use cases.

The intended way to do this is using a `TypeAdapter`.

We export ModelMessagesTypeAdapter that can be used for this, or you can create your own.

Here's an example showing how:

serialize messages to json

```python
from pydantic_core import to_jsonable_python

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessagesTypeAdapter  # (1)!

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
history_step_1 = result1.all_messages()
as_python_objects = to_jsonable_python(history_step_1)  # (2)!
same_history_as_step_1 = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_python(as_python_objects)

result2 = agent.run_sync(  # (3)!
    'Tell me a different joke.', message_history=same_history_as_step_1
)

```

1. Alternatively, you can create a `TypeAdapter` from scratch:
   ```python
   from pydantic import TypeAdapter
   from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
   ModelMessagesTypeAdapter = TypeAdapter(list[ModelMessage])

   ```
1. Alternatively you can serialize to/from JSON directly:
   ```python
   from pydantic_core import to_json
   ...
   as_json_objects = to_json(history_step_1)
   same_history_as_step_1 = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_json(as_json_objects)

   ```
1. You can now continue the conversation with history `same_history_as_step_1` despite creating a new agent run.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Other ways of using messages

Since messages are defined by simple dataclasses, you can manually create and manipulate, e.g. for testing.

The message format is independent of the model used, so you can use messages in different agents, or the same agent with different models.

In the example below, we reuse the message from the first agent run, which uses the `openai:gpt-4o` model, in a second agent run using the `google-gla:gemini-1.5-pro` model.

Reusing messages with a different model

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', system_prompt='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
print(result1.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

result2 = agent.run_sync(
    'Explain?',
    model='google-gla:gemini-1.5-pro',
    message_history=result1.new_messages(),
)
print(result2.output)
#> This is an excellent joke invented by Samuel Colvin, it needs no explanation.

print(result2.all_messages())
"""
[
    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            SystemPromptPart(
                content='Be a helpful assistant.',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            ),
            UserPromptPart(
                content='Tell me a joke.',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            ),
        ]
    ),
    ModelResponse(
        parts=[
            TextPart(
                content='Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.'
            )
        ],
        usage=Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=60, response_tokens=12, total_tokens=72),
        model_name='gpt-4o',
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
    ),
    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            UserPromptPart(
                content='Explain?',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            )
        ]
    ),
    ModelResponse(
        parts=[
            TextPart(
                content='This is an excellent joke invented by Samuel Colvin, it needs no explanation.'
            )
        ],
        usage=Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=61, response_tokens=26, total_tokens=87),
        model_name='gemini-1.5-pro',
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
    ),
]
"""

```

## Processing Message History

Sometimes you may want to modify the message history before it's sent to the model. This could be for privacy reasons (filtering out sensitive information), to save costs on tokens, to give less context to the LLM, or custom processing logic.

Pydantic AI provides a `history_processors` parameter on `Agent` that allows you to intercept and modify the message history before each model request.

### Usage

The `history_processors` is a list of callables that take a list of ModelMessage and return a modified list of the same type.

Each processor is applied in sequence, and processors can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

simple_history_processor.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelMessage,
    ModelRequest,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    UserPromptPart,
)


def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    """Remove all ModelResponse messages, keeping only ModelRequest messages."""
    return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]

# Create agent with history processor
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', history_processors=[filter_responses])

# Example: Create some conversation history
message_history = [
    ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='What is 2+2?')]),
    ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='2+2 equals 4')]),  # This will be filtered out
]

# When you run the agent, the history processor will filter out ModelResponse messages
# result = agent.run_sync('What about 3+3?', message_history=message_history)

```

#### Keep Only Recent Messages

You can use the `history_processor` to only keep the recent messages:

keep_recent_messages.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage


async def keep_recent_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    """Keep only the last 5 messages to manage token usage."""
    return messages[-5:] if len(messages) > 5 else messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', history_processors=[keep_recent_messages])

# Example: Even with a long conversation history, only the last 5 messages are sent to the model
long_conversation_history: list[ModelMessage] = []  # Your long conversation history here
# result = agent.run_sync('What did we discuss?', message_history=long_conversation_history)

```

#### `RunContext` parameter

History processors can optionally accept a RunContext parameter to access additional information about the current run, such as dependencies, model information, and usage statistics:

context_aware_processor.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
from pydantic_ai.tools import RunContext


def context_aware_processor(
    ctx: RunContext[None],
    messages: list[ModelMessage],
) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    # Access current usage
    current_tokens = ctx.usage.total_tokens

    # Filter messages based on context
    if current_tokens > 1000:
        return messages[-3:]  # Keep only recent messages when token usage is high
    return messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', history_processors=[context_aware_processor])

```

This allows for more sophisticated message processing based on the current state of the agent run.

#### Summarize Old Messages

Use an LLM to summarize older messages to preserve context while reducing tokens.

summarize_old_messages.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage

# Use a cheaper model to summarize old messages.
summarize_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o-mini',
    instructions="""
Summarize this conversation, omitting small talk and unrelated topics.
Focus on the technical discussion and next steps.
""",
)


async def summarize_old_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    # Summarize the oldest 10 messages
    if len(messages) > 10:
        oldest_messages = messages[:10]
        summary = await summarize_agent.run(message_history=oldest_messages)
        # Return the last message and the summary
        return summary.new_messages() + messages[-1:]

    return messages


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', history_processors=[summarize_old_messages])

```

### Testing History Processors

You can test what messages are actually sent to the model provider using FunctionModel:

test_history_processor.py

```python
import pytest

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelMessage,
    ModelRequest,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    UserPromptPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel


@pytest.fixture
def received_messages() -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return []


@pytest.fixture
def function_model(received_messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> FunctionModel:
    def capture_model_function(messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo) -> ModelResponse:
        # Capture the messages that the provider actually receives
        received_messages.clear()
        received_messages.extend(messages)
        return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='Provider response')])

    return FunctionModel(capture_model_function)


def test_history_processor(function_model: FunctionModel, received_messages: list[ModelMessage]):
    def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
        return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]

    agent = Agent(function_model, history_processors=[filter_responses])

    message_history = [
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 1')]),
        ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='Answer 1')]),
    ]

    agent.run_sync('Question 2', message_history=message_history)
    assert received_messages == [
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 1')]),
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 2')]),
    ]

```

### Multiple Processors

You can also use multiple processors:

multiple_history_processors.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage, ModelRequest


def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]


def summarize_old_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return messages[-5:]


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', history_processors=[filter_responses, summarize_old_messages])

```

In this case, the `filter_responses` processor will be applied first, and the `summarize_old_messages` processor will be applied second.

## Examples

For a more complete example of using messages in conversations, see the [chat app](../examples/chat-app/) example.

# Multi-agent Applications

There are roughly four levels of complexity when building applications with Pydantic AI:

1. Single agent workflows â€” what most of the `pydantic_ai` documentation covers
1. [Agent delegation](#agent-delegation) â€” agents using another agent via tools
1. [Programmatic agent hand-off](#programmatic-agent-hand-off) â€” one agent runs, then application code calls another agent
1. [Graph based control flow](../graph/) â€” for the most complex cases, a graph-based state machine can be used to control the execution of multiple agents

Of course, you can combine multiple strategies in a single application.

## Agent delegation

"Agent delegation" refers to the scenario where an agent delegates work to another agent, then takes back control when the delegate agent (the agent called from within a tool) finishes. If you want to hand off control to another agent completely, without coming back to the first agent, you can use an [output function](../output/#output-functions).

Since agents are stateless and designed to be global, you do not need to include the agent itself in agent [dependencies](../dependencies/).

You'll generally want to pass ctx.usage to the usage keyword argument of the delegate agent run so usage within that run counts towards the total usage of the parent agent run.

Multiple models

Agent delegation doesn't need to use the same model for each agent. If you choose to use different models within a run, calculating the monetary cost from the final result.usage() of the run will not be possible, but you can still use UsageLimits to avoid unexpected costs.

agent_delegation_simple.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits

joke_selection_agent = Agent(  # (1)!
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the `joke_factory` to generate some jokes, then choose the best. '
        'You must return just a single joke.'
    ),
)
joke_generation_agent = Agent(  # (2)!
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash', output_type=list[str]
)


@joke_selection_agent.tool
async def joke_factory(ctx: RunContext[None], count: int) -> list[str]:
    r = await joke_generation_agent.run(  # (3)!
        f'Please generate {count} jokes.',
        usage=ctx.usage,  # (4)!
    )
    return r.output  # (5)!


result = joke_selection_agent.run_sync(
    'Tell me a joke.',
    usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=5, total_tokens_limit=300),
)
print(result.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.
print(result.usage())
#> Usage(requests=3, request_tokens=204, response_tokens=24, total_tokens=228)

```

1. The "parent" or controlling agent.
1. The "delegate" agent, which is called from within a tool of the parent agent.
1. Call the delegate agent from within a tool of the parent agent.
1. Pass the usage from the parent agent to the delegate agent so the final result.usage() includes the usage from both agents.
1. Since the function returns `list[str]`, and the `output_type` of `joke_generation_agent` is also `list[str]`, we can simply return `r.output` from the tool.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

The control flow for this example is pretty simple and can be summarised as follows:

```
graph TD
  START --> joke_selection_agent
  joke_selection_agent --> joke_factory["joke_factory (tool)"]
  joke_factory --> joke_generation_agent
  joke_generation_agent --> joke_factory
  joke_factory --> joke_selection_agent
  joke_selection_agent --> END
```

### Agent delegation and dependencies

Generally the delegate agent needs to either have the same [dependencies](../dependencies/) as the calling agent, or dependencies which are a subset of the calling agent's dependencies.

Initializing dependencies

We say "generally" above since there's nothing to stop you initializing dependencies within a tool call and therefore using interdependencies in a delegate agent that are not available on the parent, this should often be avoided since it can be significantly slower than reusing connections etc. from the parent agent.

agent_delegation_deps.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import httpx

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext


@dataclass
class ClientAndKey:  # (1)!
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient
    api_key: str


joke_selection_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=ClientAndKey,  # (2)!
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the `joke_factory` tool to generate some jokes on the given subject, '
        'then choose the best. You must return just a single joke.'
    ),
)
joke_generation_agent = Agent(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=ClientAndKey,  # (4)!
    output_type=list[str],
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the "get_jokes" tool to get some jokes on the given subject, '
        'then extract each joke into a list.'
    ),
)


@joke_selection_agent.tool
async def joke_factory(ctx: RunContext[ClientAndKey], count: int) -> list[str]:
    r = await joke_generation_agent.run(
        f'Please generate {count} jokes.',
        deps=ctx.deps,  # (3)!
        usage=ctx.usage,
    )
    return r.output


@joke_generation_agent.tool  # (5)!
async def get_jokes(ctx: RunContext[ClientAndKey], count: int) -> str:
    response = await ctx.deps.http_client.get(
        'https://example.com',
        params={'count': count},
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {ctx.deps.api_key}'},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text


async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        deps = ClientAndKey(client, 'foobar')
        result = await joke_selection_agent.run('Tell me a joke.', deps=deps)
        print(result.output)
        #> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.
        print(result.usage())  # (6)!
        #> Usage(requests=4, request_tokens=309, response_tokens=32, total_tokens=341)

```

1. Define a dataclass to hold the client and API key dependencies.
1. Set the `deps_type` of the calling agent â€” `joke_selection_agent` here.
1. Pass the dependencies to the delegate agent's run method within the tool call.
1. Also set the `deps_type` of the delegate agent â€” `joke_generation_agent` here.
1. Define a tool on the delegate agent that uses the dependencies to make an HTTP request.
1. Usage now includes 4 requests â€” 2 from the calling agent and 2 from the delegate agent.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

This example shows how even a fairly simple agent delegation can lead to a complex control flow:

```
graph TD
  START --> joke_selection_agent
  joke_selection_agent --> joke_factory["joke_factory (tool)"]
  joke_factory --> joke_generation_agent
  joke_generation_agent --> get_jokes["get_jokes (tool)"]
  get_jokes --> http_request["HTTP request"]
  http_request --> get_jokes
  get_jokes --> joke_generation_agent
  joke_generation_agent --> joke_factory
  joke_factory --> joke_selection_agent
  joke_selection_agent --> END
```

## Programmatic agent hand-off

"Programmatic agent hand-off" refers to the scenario where multiple agents are called in succession, with application code and/or a human in the loop responsible for deciding which agent to call next.

Here agents don't need to use the same deps.

Here we show two agents used in succession, the first to find a flight and the second to extract the user's seat preference.

programmatic_handoff.py

```python
from typing import Literal, Union

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from rich.prompt import Prompt

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
from pydantic_ai.usage import Usage, UsageLimits


class FlightDetails(BaseModel):
    flight_number: str


class Failed(BaseModel):
    """Unable to find a satisfactory choice."""


flight_search_agent = Agent[None, Union[FlightDetails, Failed]](  # (1)!
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    output_type=Union[FlightDetails, Failed],  # type: ignore
    system_prompt=(
        'Use the "flight_search" tool to find a flight '
        'from the given origin to the given destination.'
    ),
)


@flight_search_agent.tool  # (2)!
async def flight_search(
    ctx: RunContext[None], origin: str, destination: str
) -> Union[FlightDetails, None]:
    # in reality, this would call a flight search API or
    # use a browser to scrape a flight search website
    return FlightDetails(flight_number='AK456')


usage_limits = UsageLimits(request_limit=15)  # (3)!


async def find_flight(usage: Usage) -> Union[FlightDetails, None]:  # (4)!
    message_history: Union[list[ModelMessage], None] = None
    for _ in range(3):
        prompt = Prompt.ask(
            'Where would you like to fly from and to?',
        )
        result = await flight_search_agent.run(
            prompt,
            message_history=message_history,
            usage=usage,
            usage_limits=usage_limits,
        )
        if isinstance(result.output, FlightDetails):
            return result.output
        else:
            message_history = result.all_messages(
                output_tool_return_content='Please try again.'
            )


class SeatPreference(BaseModel):
    row: int = Field(ge=1, le=30)
    seat: Literal['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']


# This agent is responsible for extracting the user's seat selection
seat_preference_agent = Agent[None, Union[SeatPreference, Failed]](  # (5)!
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    output_type=Union[SeatPreference, Failed],  # type: ignore
    system_prompt=(
        "Extract the user's seat preference. "
        'Seats A and F are window seats. '
        'Row 1 is the front row and has extra leg room. '
        'Rows 14, and 20 also have extra leg room. '
    ),
)


async def find_seat(usage: Usage) -> SeatPreference:  # (6)!
    message_history: Union[list[ModelMessage], None] = None
    while True:
        answer = Prompt.ask('What seat would you like?')

        result = await seat_preference_agent.run(
            answer,
            message_history=message_history,
            usage=usage,
            usage_limits=usage_limits,
        )
        if isinstance(result.output, SeatPreference):
            return result.output
        else:
            print('Could not understand seat preference. Please try again.')
            message_history = result.all_messages()


async def main():  # (7)!
    usage: Usage = Usage()

    opt_flight_details = await find_flight(usage)
    if opt_flight_details is not None:
        print(f'Flight found: {opt_flight_details.flight_number}')
        #> Flight found: AK456
        seat_preference = await find_seat(usage)
        print(f'Seat preference: {seat_preference}')
        #> Seat preference: row=1 seat='A'

```

1. Define the first agent, which finds a flight. We use an explicit type annotation until [PEP-747](https://peps.python.org/pep-0747/) lands, see [structured output](../output/#structured-output). We use a union as the output type so the model can communicate if it's unable to find a satisfactory choice; internally, each member of the union will be registered as a separate tool.
1. Define a tool on the agent to find a flight. In this simple case we could dispense with the tool and just define the agent to return structured data, then search for a flight, but in more complex scenarios the tool would be necessary.
1. Define usage limits for the entire app.
1. Define a function to find a flight, which asks the user for their preferences and then calls the agent to find a flight.
1. As with `flight_search_agent` above, we use an explicit type annotation to define the agent.
1. Define a function to find the user's seat preference, which asks the user for their seat preference and then calls the agent to extract the seat preference.
1. Now that we've put our logic for running each agent into separate functions, our main app becomes very simple.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

The control flow for this example can be summarised as follows:

```
graph TB
  START --> ask_user_flight["ask user for flight"]

  subgraph find_flight
    flight_search_agent --> ask_user_flight
    ask_user_flight --> flight_search_agent
  end

  flight_search_agent --> ask_user_seat["ask user for seat"]
  flight_search_agent --> END

  subgraph find_seat
    seat_preference_agent --> ask_user_seat
    ask_user_seat --> seat_preference_agent
  end

  seat_preference_agent --> END
```

## Pydantic Graphs

See the [graph](../graph/) documentation on when and how to use graphs.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use dependencies in Pydantic AI:

- [Flight booking](../examples/flight-booking/)

# Function Tools

Function tools provide a mechanism for models to perform actions and retrieve extra information to help them generate a response.

They're useful when you want to enable the model to take some action and use the result, when it is impractical or impossible to put all the context an agent might need into the instructions, or when you want to make agents' behavior more deterministic or reliable by deferring some of the logic required to generate a response to another (not necessarily AI-powered) tool.

If you want a model to be able to call a function as its final action, without the result being sent back to the model, you can use an [output function](../output/#output-functions) instead.

There are a number of ways to register tools with an agent:

- via the @agent.tool decorator â€” for tools that need access to the agent context
- via the @agent.tool_plain decorator â€” for tools that do not need access to the agent context
- via the tools keyword argument to `Agent` which can take either plain functions, or instances of Tool

For more advanced use cases, the [toolsets](../toolsets/) feature lets you manage collections of tools (built by you or providd by an [MCP server](../mcp/client/) or other [third party](#third-party-tools)) and register them with an agent in one go via the toolsets keyword argument to `Agent`.

Function tools vs. RAG

Function tools are basically the "R" of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â€” they augment what the model can do by letting it request extra information.

The main semantic difference between Pydantic AI Tools and RAG is RAG is synonymous with vector search, while Pydantic AI tools are more general-purpose. (Note: we may add support for vector search functionality in the future, particularly an API for generating embeddings. See [#58](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/58))

Function Tools vs. Structured Outputs

As the name suggests, function tools use the model's "tools" or "functions" API to let the model know what is available to call. Tools or functions are also used to define the schema(s) for [structured output](../output/) when using the default [tool output mode](../output/#tool-output), thus a model might have access to many tools, some of which call function tools while others end the run and produce a final output.

## Registering via Decorator

`@agent.tool` is considered the default decorator since in the majority of cases tools will need access to the agent context.

Here's an example using both:

dice_game.py

```python
import random

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',  # (1)!
    deps_type=str,  # (2)!
    system_prompt=(
        "You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number "
        "you get back matches the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner. "
        "Use the player's name in the response."
    ),
)


@agent.tool_plain  # (3)!
def roll_dice() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))


@agent.tool  # (4)!
def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps


dice_result = agent.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')  # (5)!
print(dice_result.output)
#> Congratulations Anne, you guessed correctly! You're a winner!

```

1. This is a pretty simple task, so we can use the fast and cheap Gemini flash model.
1. We pass the user's name as the dependency, to keep things simple we use just the name as a string as the dependency.
1. This tool doesn't need any context, it just returns a random number. You could probably use dynamic instructions in this case.
1. This tool needs the player's name, so it uses `RunContext` to access dependencies which are just the player's name in this case.
1. Run the agent, passing the player's name as the dependency.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Let's print the messages from that game to see what happened:

dice_game_messages.py

```python
from dice_game import dice_result

print(dice_result.all_messages())

                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            ),

We can represent this with a diagram:

## Registering via Agent Argument

As well as using the decorators, we can register tools via the `tools` argument to the Agent constructor. This is useful when you want to reuse tools, and can also give more fine-grained control over the tools.

dice_game_tool_kwarg.py

```python
import random

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext, Tool

system_prompt = """\
You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number
you get back matches the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner.
Use the player's name in the response.
"""


def roll_dice() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))


def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps


agent_a = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=str,
    tools=[roll_dice, get_player_name],  # (1)!
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
)
agent_b = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash',
    deps_type=str,
    tools=[  # (2)!
        Tool(roll_dice, takes_ctx=False),
        Tool(get_player_name, takes_ctx=True),
    ],
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
)

dice_result = {}
dice_result['a'] = agent_a.run_sync('My guess is 6', deps='Yashar')
dice_result['b'] = agent_b.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')
print(dice_result['a'].output)
#> Tough luck, Yashar, you rolled a 4. Better luck next time.
print(dice_result['b'].output)
#> Congratulations Anne, you guessed correctly! You're a winner!

```

1. The simplest way to register tools via the `Agent` constructor is to pass a list of functions, the function signature is inspected to determine if the tool takes RunContext.
1. `agent_a` and `agent_b` are identical â€” but we can use Tool to reuse tool definitions and give more fine-grained control over how tools are defined, e.g. setting their name or description, or using a custom [`prepare`](#tool-prepare) method.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Tool Output

Tools can return anything that Pydantic can serialize to JSON, as well as audio, video, image or document content depending on the types of [multi-modal input](../input/) the model supports:

function_tool_output.py

```python
from datetime import datetime

from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent, DocumentUrl, ImageUrl
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIResponsesModel


class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


agent = Agent(model=OpenAIResponsesModel('gpt-4o'))


@agent.tool_plain
def get_current_time() -> datetime:
    return datetime.now()


@agent.tool_plain
def get_user() -> User:
    return User(name='John', age=30)


@agent.tool_plain
def get_company_logo() -> ImageUrl:
    return ImageUrl(url='https://iili.io/3Hs4FMg.png')


@agent.tool_plain
def get_document() -> DocumentUrl:
    return DocumentUrl(url='https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf')


result = agent.run_sync('What time is it?')
print(result.output)
#> The current time is 10:45 PM on April 17, 2025.

result = agent.run_sync('What is the user name?')
print(result.output)
#> The user's name is John.

result = agent.run_sync('What is the company name in the logo?')
print(result.output)
#> The company name in the logo is "Pydantic."

result = agent.run_sync('What is the main content of the document?')
print(result.output)
#> The document contains just the text "Dummy PDF file."

```

Some models (e.g. Gemini) natively support semi-structured return values, while some expect text (OpenAI) but seem to be just as good at extracting meaning from the data. If a Python object is returned and the model expects a string, the value will be serialized to JSON.

### Advanced Tool Returns

For scenarios where you need more control over both the tool's return value and the content sent to the model, you can use ToolReturn. This is particularly useful when you want to:

- Provide rich multi-modal content (images, documents, etc.) to the model as context
- Separate the programmatic return value from the model's context
- Include additional metadata that shouldn't be sent to the LLM

Here's an example of a computer automation tool that captures screenshots and provides visual feedback:

advanced_tool_return.py

```python
import time
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ToolReturn, BinaryContent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

@agent.tool_plain
def click_and_capture(x: int, y: int) -> ToolReturn:
    """Click at coordinates and show before/after screenshots."""
    # Take screenshot before action
    before_screenshot = capture_screen()

    # Perform click operation
    perform_click(x, y)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for UI to update

    # Take screenshot after action
    after_screenshot = capture_screen()

    return ToolReturn(
        return_value=f"Successfully clicked at ({x}, {y})",
        content=[
            f"Clicked at coordinates ({x}, {y}). Here's the comparison:",
            "Before:",
            BinaryContent(data=before_screenshot, media_type="image/png"),
            "After:",
            BinaryContent(data=after_screenshot, media_type="image/png"),
            "Please analyze the changes and suggest next steps."
        ],
        metadata={
            "coordinates": {"x": x, "y": y},
            "action_type": "click_and_capture",
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
    )

# The model receives the rich visual content for analysis
# while your application can access the structured return_value and metadata
result = agent.run_sync("Click on the submit button and tell me what happened")
print(result.output)
# The model can analyze the screenshots and provide detailed feedback

```

- **`return_value`**: The actual return value used in the tool response. This is what gets serialized and sent back to the model as the tool's result.
- **`content`**: A sequence of content (text, images, documents, etc.) that provides additional context to the model. This appears as a separate user message.
- **`metadata`**: Optional metadata that your application can access but is not sent to the LLM. Useful for logging, debugging, or additional processing. Some other AI frameworks call this feature "artifacts".

This separation allows you to provide rich context to the model while maintaining clean, structured return values for your application logic.

## Tool Schema

Function parameters are extracted from the function signature, and all parameters except `RunContext` are used to build the schema for that tool call.

Even better, Pydantic AI extracts the docstring from functions and (thanks to [griffe](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/)) extracts parameter descriptions from the docstring and adds them to the schema.

[Griffe supports](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/reference/docstrings/#docstrings) extracting parameter descriptions from `google`, `numpy`, and `sphinx` style docstrings. Pydantic AI will infer the format to use based on the docstring, but you can explicitly set it using docstring_format. You can also enforce parameter requirements by setting `require_parameter_descriptions=True`. This will raise a UserError if a parameter description is missing.

To demonstrate a tool's schema, here we use FunctionModel to print the schema a model would receive:

tool_schema.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage, ModelResponse, TextPart
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel

agent = Agent()


@agent.tool_plain(docstring_format='google', require_parameter_descriptions=True)
def foobar(a: int, b: str, c: dict[str, list[float]]) -> str:
    """Get me foobar.

    Args:
        a: apple pie
        b: banana cake
        c: carrot smoothie
    """
    return f'{a} {b} {c}'


def print_schema(messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo) -> ModelResponse:
    tool = info.function_tools[0]
    print(tool.description)
    #> Get me foobar.
    print(tool.parameters_json_schema)
    """
    {
        'additionalProperties': False,
        'properties': {
            'a': {'description': 'apple pie', 'type': 'integer'},
            'b': {'description': 'banana cake', 'type': 'string'},
            'c': {
                'additionalProperties': {'items': {'type': 'number'}, 'type': 'array'},
                'description': 'carrot smoothie',
                'type': 'object',
            },
        },
        'required': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
        'type': 'object',
    }
    """
    return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart('foobar')])


agent.run_sync('hello', model=FunctionModel(print_schema))

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

If a tool has a single parameter that can be represented as an object in JSON schema (e.g. dataclass, TypedDict, pydantic model), the schema for the tool is simplified to be just that object.

Here's an example where we use TestModel.last_model_request_parameters to inspect the tool schema that would be passed to the model.

single_parameter_tool.py

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel

agent = Agent()


class Foobar(BaseModel):
    """This is a Foobar"""

    x: int
    y: str
    z: float = 3.14


@agent.tool_plain
def foobar(f: Foobar) -> str:
    return str(f)


test_model = TestModel()
result = agent.run_sync('hello', model=test_model)
print(result.output)
#> {"foobar":"x=0 y='a' z=3.14"}
print(test_model.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools)
"""
[
    ToolDefinition(
        name='foobar',
        parameters_json_schema={
            'properties': {
                'x': {'type': 'integer'},
                'y': {'type': 'string'},
                'z': {'default': 3.14, 'type': 'number'},
            },
            'required': ['x', 'y'],
            'title': 'Foobar',
            'type': 'object',
        },
        description='This is a Foobar',
    )
]
"""

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

### Custom Tool Schema

If you have a function that lacks appropriate documentation (i.e. poorly named, no type information, poor docstring, use of \*args or \*\*kwargs and suchlike) then you can still turn it into a tool that can be effectively used by the agent with the Tool.from_schema function. With this you provide the name, description and JSON schema for the function directly:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, Tool
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel


def foobar(**kwargs) -> str:
    return kwargs['a'] + kwargs['b']

tool = Tool.from_schema(
    function=foobar,
    name='sum',
    description='Sum two numbers.',
    json_schema={
        'additionalProperties': False,
        'properties': {
            'a': {'description': 'the first number', 'type': 'integer'},
            'b': {'description': 'the second number', 'type': 'integer'},
        },
        'required': ['a', 'b'],
        'type': 'object',
    }
)

test_model = TestModel()
agent = Agent(test_model, tools=[tool])

result = agent.run_sync('testing...')
print(result.output)
#> {"sum":0}

```

Please note that validation of the tool arguments will not be performed, and this will pass all arguments as keyword arguments.

## Dynamic Tools

Tools can optionally be defined with another function: `prepare`, which is called at each step of a run to customize the definition of the tool passed to the model, or omit the tool completely from that step.

A `prepare` method can be registered via the `prepare` kwarg to any of the tool registration mechanisms:

- @agent.tool decorator
- @agent.tool_plain decorator
- Tool dataclass

The `prepare` method, should be of type ToolPrepareFunc, a function which takes RunContext and a pre-built ToolDefinition, and should either return that `ToolDefinition` with or without modifying it, return a new `ToolDefinition`, or return `None` to indicate this tools should not be registered for that step.

Here's a simple `prepare` method that only includes the tool if the value of the dependency is `42`.

As with the previous example, we use TestModel to demonstrate the behavior without calling a real model.

tool_only_if_42.py

```python
from typing import Union

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import ToolDefinition

agent = Agent('test')


async def only_if_42(
    ctx: RunContext[int], tool_def: ToolDefinition
) -> Union[ToolDefinition, None]:
    if ctx.deps == 42:
        return tool_def


@agent.tool(prepare=only_if_42)
def hitchhiker(ctx: RunContext[int], answer: str) -> str:
    return f'{ctx.deps} {answer}'


result = agent.run_sync('testing...', deps=41)
print(result.output)
#> success (no tool calls)
result = agent.run_sync('testing...', deps=42)
print(result.output)
#> {"hitchhiker":"42 a"}

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Here's a more complex example where we change the description of the `name` parameter to based on the value of `deps`

For the sake of variation, we create this tool using the Tool dataclass.

customize_name.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Literal

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.tools import Tool, ToolDefinition


def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f'hello {name}'


async def prepare_greet(
    ctx: RunContext[Literal['human', 'machine']], tool_def: ToolDefinition
) -> ToolDefinition | None:
    d = f'Name of the {ctx.deps} to greet.'
    tool_def.parameters_json_schema['properties']['name']['description'] = d
    return tool_def


greet_tool = Tool(greet, prepare=prepare_greet)
test_model = TestModel()
agent = Agent(test_model, tools=[greet_tool], deps_type=Literal['human', 'machine'])

result = agent.run_sync('testing...', deps='human')
print(result.output)
#> {"greet":"hello a"}
print(test_model.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools)
"""
[
    ToolDefinition(
        name='greet',
        parameters_json_schema={
            'additionalProperties': False,
            'properties': {
                'name': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Name of the human to greet.'}
            },
            'required': ['name'],
            'type': 'object',
        },
    )
]
"""

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

### Agent-wide Dynamic Tools

In addition to per-tool `prepare` methods, you can also define an agent-wide `prepare_tools` function. This function is called at each step of a run and allows you to filter or modify the list of all tool definitions available to the agent for that step. This is especially useful if you want to enable or disable multiple tools at once, or apply global logic based on the current context.

The `prepare_tools` function should be of type ToolsPrepareFunc, which takes the RunContext and a list of ToolDefinition, and returns a new list of tool definitions (or `None` to disable all tools for that step).

Note

The list of tool definitions passed to `prepare_tools` includes both regular function tools and tools from any [toolsets](../toolsets/) registered to the agent, but not [output tools](../output/#tool-output).

To modify output tools, you can set a `prepare_output_tools` function instead.

Here's an example that makes all tools strict if the model is an OpenAI model:

agent_prepare_tools_customize.py

```python
from dataclasses import replace
from typing import Union

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import ToolDefinition
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel


async def turn_on_strict_if_openai(
    ctx: RunContext[None], tool_defs: list[ToolDefinition]
) -> Union[list[ToolDefinition], None]:
    if ctx.model.system == 'openai':
        return [replace(tool_def, strict=True) for tool_def in tool_defs]
    return tool_defs


test_model = TestModel()
agent = Agent(test_model, prepare_tools=turn_on_strict_if_openai)


@agent.tool_plain
def echo(message: str) -> str:
    return message


agent.run_sync('testing...')
assert test_model.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools[0].strict is None

# Set the system attribute of the test_model to 'openai'
test_model._system = 'openai'

agent.run_sync('testing with openai...')
assert test_model.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools[0].strict

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Here's another example that conditionally filters out the tools by name if the dependency (`ctx.deps`) is `True`:

agent_prepare_tools_filter_out.py

```python
from typing import Union

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import Tool, ToolDefinition


def launch_potato(target: str) -> str:
    return f'Potato launched at {target}!'


async def filter_out_tools_by_name(
    ctx: RunContext[bool], tool_defs: list[ToolDefinition]
) -> Union[list[ToolDefinition], None]:
    if ctx.deps:
        return [tool_def for tool_def in tool_defs if tool_def.name != 'launch_potato']
    return tool_defs


agent = Agent(
    'test',
    tools=[Tool(launch_potato)],
    prepare_tools=filter_out_tools_by_name,
    deps_type=bool,
)

result = agent.run_sync('testing...', deps=False)
print(result.output)
#> {"launch_potato":"Potato launched at a!"}
result = agent.run_sync('testing...', deps=True)
print(result.output)
#> success (no tool calls)

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

You can use `prepare_tools` to:

- Dynamically enable or disable tools based on the current model, dependencies, or other context
- Modify tool definitions globally (e.g., set all tools to strict mode, change descriptions, etc.)

If both per-tool `prepare` and agent-wide `prepare_tools` are used, the per-tool `prepare` is applied first to each tool, and then `prepare_tools` is called with the resulting list of tool definitions.

## Tool Execution and Retries

When a tool is executed, its arguments (provided by the LLM) are first validated against the function's signature using Pydantic. If validation fails (e.g., due to incorrect types or missing required arguments), a `ValidationError` is raised, and the framework automatically generates a RetryPromptPart containing the validation details. This prompt is sent back to the LLM, informing it of the error and allowing it to correct the parameters and retry the tool call.

Beyond automatic validation errors, the tool's own internal logic can also explicitly request a retry by raising the ModelRetry exception. This is useful for situations where the parameters were technically valid, but an issue occurred during execution (like a transient network error, or the tool determining the initial attempt needs modification).

```python
from pydantic_ai import ModelRetry


def my_flaky_tool(query: str) -> str:
    if query == 'bad':
        # Tell the LLM the query was bad and it should try again
        raise ModelRetry("The query 'bad' is not allowed. Please provide a different query.")
    # ... process query ...
    return 'Success!'

```

Raising `ModelRetry` also generates a `RetryPromptPart` containing the exception message, which is sent back to the LLM to guide its next attempt. Both `ValidationError` and `ModelRetry` respect the `retries` setting configured on the `Tool` or `Agent`.

## Third-Party Tools

### MCP Tools

See the [MCP Client](../mcp/client/) documentation for how to use MCP servers with Pydantic AI as [toolsets](../toolsets/).

### LangChain Tools

If you'd like to use a tool from LangChain's [community tool library](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/) with Pydantic AI, you can use the tool_from_langchain convenience method. Note that Pydantic AI will not validate the arguments in this case -- it's up to the model to provide arguments matching the schema specified by the LangChain tool, and up to the LangChain tool to raise an error if the arguments are invalid.

You will need to install the `langchain-community` package and any others required by the tool in question.

Here is how you can use the LangChain `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` tool, which requires the `ddgs` package:

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ext.langchain import tool_from_langchain


search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
search_tool = tool_from_langchain(search)

agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-2.0-flash',
    tools=[search_tool],
)

result = agent.run_sync('What is the release date of Elden Ring Nightreign?')  # (1)!
print(result.output)
#> Elden Ring Nightreign is planned to be released on May 30, 2025.

```

1. The release date of this game is the 30th of May 2025, which is after the knowledge cutoff for Gemini 2.0 (August 2024).

If you'd like to use multiple LangChain tools or a LangChain [toolkit](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/#toolkits), you can use the LangChainToolset [toolset](../toolsets/) which takes a list of LangChain tools:

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SlackToolkit

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ext.langchain import LangChainToolset


toolkit = SlackToolkit()
toolset = LangChainToolset(toolkit.get_tools())

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[toolset])
# ...

```

### ACI.dev Tools

If you'd like to use a tool from the [ACI.dev tool library](https://www.aci.dev/tools) with Pydantic AI, you can use the tool_from_aci convenience method. Note that Pydantic AI will not validate the arguments in this case -- it's up to the model to provide arguments matching the schema specified by the ACI tool, and up to the ACI tool to raise an error if the arguments are invalid.

You will need to install the `aci-sdk` package, set your ACI API key in the `ACI_API_KEY` environment variable, and pass your ACI "linked account owner ID" to the function.

Here is how you can use the ACI.dev `TAVILY__SEARCH` tool:

```python
import os

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ext.aci import tool_from_aci


tavily_search = tool_from_aci(
    'TAVILY__SEARCH',
    linked_account_owner_id=os.getenv('LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER_ID'),
)

agent = Agent(
    'google-gla:gemini-2.0-flash',
    tools=[tavily_search],
)

result = agent.run_sync('What is the release date of Elden Ring Nightreign?')  # (1)!
print(result.output)
#> Elden Ring Nightreign is planned to be released on May 30, 2025.

```

1. The release date of this game is the 30th of May 2025, which is after the knowledge cutoff for Gemini 2.0 (August 2024).

If you'd like to use multiple ACI.dev tools, you can use the ACIToolset [toolset](../toolsets/) which takes a list of ACI tool names as well as the `linked_account_owner_id`:

```python
import os

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ext.aci import ACIToolset


toolset = ACIToolset(
    [
        'OPEN_WEATHER_MAP__CURRENT_WEATHER',
        'OPEN_WEATHER_MAP__FORECAST',
    ],
    linked_account_owner_id=os.getenv('LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER_ID'),
)

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[toolset])

```
# Models

# Model Providers

Pydantic AI is model-agnostic and has built-in support for multiple model providers:

- [OpenAI](openai/)
- [Anthropic](anthropic/)
- [Gemini](gemini/) (via two different APIs: Generative Language API and VertexAI API)
- [Groq](groq/)
- [Mistral](mistral/)
- [Cohere](cohere/)
- [Bedrock](bedrock/)
- [Hugging Face](huggingface/)

## OpenAI-compatible Providers

In addition, many providers are compatible with the OpenAI API, and can be used with `OpenAIModel` in Pydantic AI:

- [DeepSeek](openai/#deepseek)
- [Grok (xAI)](openai/#grok-xai)
- [Ollama](openai/#ollama)
- [OpenRouter](openai/#openrouter)
- [Perplexity](openai/#perplexity)
- [Fireworks AI](openai/#fireworks-ai)
- [Together AI](openai/#together-ai)
- [Azure AI Foundry](openai/#azure-ai-foundry)
- [Heroku](openai/#heroku-ai)
- [GitHub Models](openai/#github-models)

Pydantic AI also comes with [`TestModel`](../api/models/test/) and [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function/) for testing and development.

To use each model provider, you need to configure your local environment and make sure you have the right packages installed.

## Models and Providers

Pydantic AI uses a few key terms to describe how it interacts with different LLMs:

- **Model**: This refers to the Pydantic AI class used to make requests following a specific LLM API (generally by wrapping a vendor-provided SDK, like the `openai` python SDK). These classes implement a vendor-SDK-agnostic API, ensuring a single Pydantic AI agent is portable to different LLM vendors without any other code changes just by swapping out the Model it uses. Model classes are named roughly in the format `<VendorSdk>Model`, for example, we have `OpenAIModel`, `AnthropicModel`, `GeminiModel`, etc. When using a Model class, you specify the actual LLM model name (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `gemini-1.5-flash`) as a parameter.
- **Provider**: This refers to provider-specific classes which handle the authentication and connections to an LLM vendor. Passing a non-default *Provider* as a parameter to a Model is how you can ensure that your agent will make requests to a specific endpoint, or make use of a specific approach to authentication (e.g., you can use Vertex-specific auth with the `GeminiModel` by way of the `VertexProvider`). In particular, this is how you can make use of an AI gateway, or an LLM vendor that offers API compatibility with the vendor SDK used by an existing Model (such as `OpenAIModel`).
- **Profile**: This refers to a description of how requests to a specific model or family of models need to be constructed to get the best results, independent of the model and provider classes used. For example, different models have different restrictions on the JSON schemas that can be used for tools, and the same schema transformer needs to be used for Gemini models whether you're using `GoogleModel` with model name `gemini-2.5-pro-preview`, or `OpenAIModel` with `OpenRouterProvider` and model name `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`.

When you instantiate an Agent with just a name formatted as `<provider>:<model>`, e.g. `openai:gpt-4o` or `openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`, Pydantic AI will automatically select the appropriate model class, provider, and profile. If you want to use a different provider or profile, you can instantiate a model class directly and pass in `provider` and/or `profile` arguments.

## Custom Models

To implement support for a model API that's not already supported, you will need to subclass the Model abstract base class. For streaming, you'll also need to implement the StreamedResponse abstract base class.

The best place to start is to review the source code for existing implementations, e.g. [`OpenAIModel`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/openai.py).

For details on when we'll accept contributions adding new models to Pydantic AI, see the [contributing guidelines](../contributing/#new-model-rules).

If a model API is compatible with the OpenAI API, you do not need a custom model class and can provide your own [custom provider](openai/#openai-compatible-models) instead.

## Fallback Model

You can use FallbackModel to attempt multiple models in sequence until one successfully returns a result. Under the hood, Pydantic AI automatically switches from one model to the next if the current model returns a 4xx or 5xx status code.

In the following example, the agent first makes a request to the OpenAI model (which fails due to an invalid API key), and then falls back to the Anthropic model.

fallback_model.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

openai_model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)
response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(response.data)
#> Paris

print(response.all_messages())
"""
[
    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            UserPromptPart(
                content='What is the capital of France?',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                part_kind='user-prompt',
            )
        ],
        kind='request',
    ),
    ModelResponse(
        parts=[TextPart(content='Paris', part_kind='text')],
        model_name='claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
        kind='response',
        vendor_id=None,
    ),
]
"""

```

The `ModelResponse` message above indicates in the `model_name` field that the output was returned by the Anthropic model, which is the second model specified in the `FallbackModel`.

Note

Each model's options should be configured individually. For example, `base_url`, `api_key`, and custom clients should be set on each model itself, not on the `FallbackModel`.

### Per-Model Settings

You can configure different ModelSettings for each model in a fallback chain by passing the `settings` parameter when creating each model. This is particularly useful when different providers have different optimal configurations:

fallback_model_per_settings.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.settings import ModelSettings

# Configure each model with provider-specific optimal settings
openai_model = OpenAIModel(
    'gpt-4o',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1000)  # Higher creativity for OpenAI
)
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel(
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.2, max_tokens=1000)  # Lower temperature for consistency
)

fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)
agent = Agent(fallback_model)

result = agent.run_sync('Write a creative story about space exploration')
print(result.output)
"""
In the year 2157, Captain Maya Chen piloted her spacecraft through the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy. As she discovered a planet with crystalline mountains that sang in harmony with the cosmic winds, she realized that space exploration was not just about finding new worlds, but about finding new ways to understand the universe and our place within it.
"""

```

In this example, if the OpenAI model fails, the agent will automatically fall back to the Anthropic model with its own configured settings. The `FallbackModel` itself doesn't have settings - it uses the individual settings of whichever model successfully handles the request.

In this next example, we demonstrate the exception-handling capabilities of `FallbackModel`. If all models fail, a FallbackExceptionGroup is raised, which contains all the exceptions encountered during the `run` execution.

fallback_model_failure.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import ModelHTTPError
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

openai_model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)
try:
    response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
except* ModelHTTPError as exc_group:
    for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
        print(exc)

```

Since [`except*`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star) is only supported in Python 3.11+, we use the [`exceptiongroup`](https://github.com/agronholm/exceptiongroup) backport package for earlier Python versions:

fallback_model_failure.py

```python
from exceptiongroup import catch

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import ModelHTTPError
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel


def model_status_error_handler(exc_group: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:
    for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
        print(exc)


openai_model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)
with catch({ModelHTTPError: model_status_error_handler}):
    response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')

```

By default, the `FallbackModel` only moves on to the next model if the current model raises a ModelHTTPError. You can customize this behavior by passing a custom `fallback_on` argument to the `FallbackModel` constructor.

# Anthropic

## Install

To use `AnthropicModel` models, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `anthropic` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic]"

```

## Configuration

To use [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) through their API, go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) to generate an API key.

`AnthropicModelName` contains a list of available Anthropic models.

## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `AnthropicModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

model = AnthropicModel('claude-3-5-sonnet-latest')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `Provider` via the `provider` argument:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

model = AnthropicModel(
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest', provider=AnthropicProvider(api_key='your-api-key')
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Custom HTTP Client

You can customize the `AnthropicProvider` with a custom `httpx.AsyncClient`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = AnthropicModel(
    'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
    provider=AnthropicProvider(api_key='your-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# Bedrock

## Install

To use `BedrockConverseModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `bedrock` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]"

```

## Configuration

To use [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), you'll need an AWS account with Bedrock enabled and appropriate credentials. You can use either AWS credentials directly or a pre-configured boto3 client.

`BedrockModelName` contains a list of available Bedrock models, including models from Anthropic, Amazon, Cohere, Meta, and Mistral.

## Environment variables

You can set your AWS credentials as environment variables ([among other options](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-environment-variables)):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-access-key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-secret-key'
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='us-east-1'  # or your preferred region

```

You can then use `BedrockConverseModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('bedrock:anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0')
...

```

Or initialize the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel

model = BedrockConverseModel('anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Customizing Bedrock Runtime API

You can customize the Bedrock Runtime API calls by adding additional parameters, such as [guardrail configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) and [performance settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/latency-optimized-inference.html). For a complete list of configurable parameters, refer to the documentation for BedrockModelSettings.

customize_bedrock_model_settings.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel, BedrockModelSettings

# Define Bedrock model settings with guardrail and performance configurations
bedrock_model_settings = BedrockModelSettings(
    bedrock_guardrail_config={
        'guardrailIdentifier': 'v1',
        'guardrailVersion': 'v1',
        'trace': 'enabled'
    },
    bedrock_performance_configuration={
        'latency': 'optimized'
    }
)


model = BedrockConverseModel(model_name='us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0')

agent = Agent(model=model, model_settings=bedrock_model_settings)

```

## `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `BedrockProvider` via the `provider` argument. This is useful when you want to specify credentials directly or use a custom boto3 client:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider

# Using AWS credentials directly
model = BedrockConverseModel(
    'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    provider=BedrockProvider(
        region_name='us-east-1',
        aws_access_key_id='your-access-key',
        aws_secret_access_key='your-secret-key',
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also pass a pre-configured boto3 client:

```python
import boto3

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider

# Using a pre-configured boto3 client
bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
model = BedrockConverseModel(
    'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# Cohere

## Install

To use `CohereModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `cohere` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[cohere]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[cohere]"

```

## Configuration

To use [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) through their API, go to [dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.

`CohereModelName` contains a list of the most popular Cohere models.

## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export CO_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `CohereModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('cohere:command')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.cohere import CohereModel

model = CohereModel('command')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `Provider` via the `provider` argument:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.cohere import CohereModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.cohere import CohereProvider

model = CohereModel('command', provider=CohereProvider(api_key='your-api-key'))
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize the `CohereProvider` with a custom `http_client`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.cohere import CohereModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.cohere import CohereProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = CohereModel(
    'command',
    provider=CohereProvider(api_key='your-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# Gemini

Note

We've developed a new Google model called `GoogleModel` which uses `google-genai` under the hood.

Honestly, Google packages are a mess, and that's why we've used plain `httpx` instead of relying on their own client to create `GeminiModel`. That said, it's easier to use the `google-genai` package directly, since they keep the package up-to-date with the latest API changes. For that reason, we've created a new model called `GoogleModel` which uses `google-genai` under the hood.

Check it out [here](../../api/models/google/).

Pydantic AI supports Google's Gemini models through two different APIs:

- Generative Language API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`)
- Vertex AI API (`*-aiplatform.googleapis.com`)

## Gemini via Generative Language API

### Install

To use `GeminiModel` models, you just need to install `pydantic-ai` or `pydantic-ai-slim`, no extra dependencies are required.

### Configuration

`GeminiModel` lets you use Google's Gemini models through their [Generative Language API](https://ai.google.dev/api/all-methods), `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`.

`GeminiModelName` contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface.

To use `GeminiModel`, go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and select "Create API key".

### Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key

```

You can then use `GeminiModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('google-gla:gemini-2.0-flash')
...

```

Note

The `google-gla` provider prefix represents the [Google **G**enerative **L**anguage **A**PI](https://ai.google.dev/api/all-methods) for `GeminiModel`s. `google-vertex` is used with [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models).

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name and provider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel

model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash', provider='google-gla')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `Provider` via the `provider` argument:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_gla import GoogleGLAProvider

model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash', provider=GoogleGLAProvider(api_key='your-api-key')
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize the `GoogleGLAProvider` with a custom `http_client`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_gla import GoogleGLAProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash',
    provider=GoogleGLAProvider(api_key='your-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Gemini via VertexAI

If you are an enterprise user, you should use the `google-vertex` provider with `GeminiModel` which uses the `*-aiplatform.googleapis.com` API.

`GeminiModelName` contains a list of available Gemini models that can be used through this interface.

### Install

To use the `google-vertex` provider with `GeminiModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `vertexai` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[vertexai]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[vertexai]"

```

### Configuration

This interface has a number of advantages over `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` documented above:

1. The VertexAI API comes with more enterprise readiness guarantees.
1. You can [purchase provisioned throughput](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/provisioned-throughput#purchase-provisioned-throughput) with VertexAI to guarantee capacity.
1. If you're running Pydantic AI inside GCP, you don't need to set up authentication, it should "just work".
1. You can decide which region to use, which might be important from a regulatory perspective, and might improve latency.

The big disadvantage is that for local development you may need to create and configure a "service account", which can be challenging to get right.

Whichever way you authenticate, you'll need to have VertexAI enabled in your GCP account.

### Application default credentials

Luckily if you're running Pydantic AI inside GCP, or you have the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed and configured, you should be able to use `VertexAIModel` without any additional setup.

To use `VertexAIModel`, with [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) configured (e.g. with `gcloud`), you can simply use:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel

model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash', provider='google-vertex')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

Internally this uses [`google.auth.default()`](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.auth.html) from the `google-auth` package to obtain credentials.

Won't fail until `agent.run()`

Because `google.auth.default()` requires network requests and can be slow, it's not run until you call `agent.run()`.

You may also need to pass the `project_id` argument to `GoogleVertexProvider` if application default credentials don't set a project, if you pass `project_id` and it conflicts with the project set by application default credentials, an error is raised.

### Service account

If instead of application default credentials, you want to authenticate with a service account, you'll need to create a service account, add it to your GCP project (note: this step is necessary even if you created the service account within the project), give that service account the "Vertex AI Service Agent" role, and download the service account JSON file.

Once you have the JSON file, you can use it thus:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider

model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash',
    provider=GoogleVertexProvider(service_account_file='path/to/service-account.json'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

Alternatively, if you already have the service account information in memory, you can pass it as a dictionary:

```python
import json

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider

service_account_info = json.loads(
    '{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "my-project-id"}'
)
model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash',
    provider=GoogleVertexProvider(service_account_info=service_account_info),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Customizing region

Whichever way you authenticate, you can specify which region requests will be sent to via the `region` argument.

Using a region close to your application can improve latency and might be important from a regulatory perspective.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider

model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash', provider=GoogleVertexProvider(region='asia-east1')
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize the `GoogleVertexProvider` with a custom `http_client`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google_vertex import GoogleVertexProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = GeminiModel(
    'gemini-2.0-flash',
    provider=GoogleVertexProvider(region='asia-east1', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Model settings

You can use the GeminiModelSettings class to customize the model request.

#### Disable thinking

You can disable thinking by setting the `thinking_budget` to `0` on the `google_thinking_config`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel, GeminiModelSettings

model_settings = GeminiModelSettings(gemini_thinking_config={'thinking_budget': 0})
model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=model_settings)
...

```

Check out the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) for more on thinking.

#### Safety settings

You can customize the safety settings by setting the `google_safety_settings` field.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.gemini import GeminiModel, GeminiModelSettings

model_settings = GeminiModelSettings(
    gemini_safety_settings=[
        {
            'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT',
            'threshold': 'BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH',
        }
    ]
)
model = GeminiModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=model_settings)
...

```

Check out the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings) for more on safety settings.

# Google

The `GoogleModel` is a model that uses the [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/) package under the hood to access Google's Gemini models via both the Generative Language API and Vertex AI.

## Install

To use `GoogleModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `google` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[google]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[google]"

```

______________________________________________________________________

## Configuration

`GoogleModel` lets you use Google's Gemini models through their [Generative Language API](https://ai.google.dev/api/all-methods) (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) or [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) (`*-aiplatform.googleapis.com`).

### API Key (Generative Language API)

To use Gemini via the Generative Language API, go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and create an API key.

Once you have the API key, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key

```

You can then use `GoogleModel` by explicitly creating a provider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google import GoogleProvider

provider = GoogleProvider(api_key='your-api-key')
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash', provider=provider)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Vertex AI (Enterprise/Cloud)

If you are an enterprise user, you can use the `google-vertex` provider with `GoogleModel` to access Gemini via Vertex AI.

To use Vertex AI, you may need to set up [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) or use a service account. You can also specify the region.

#### Application Default Credentials

If you have the [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed and configured, you can use:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google import GoogleProvider

provider = GoogleProvider(vertexai=True)
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash', provider=provider)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

#### Service Account

To use a service account JSON file:

google_model_service_account.py

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google import GoogleProvider

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/service-account.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'],
)
provider = GoogleProvider(credentials=credentials)
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash', provider=provider)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

#### Customizing Location

You can specify the location when using Vertex AI:

google_model_location.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google import GoogleProvider

provider = GoogleProvider(vertexai=True, location='asia-east1')
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash', provider=provider)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Provider Argument

You can supply a custom `GoogleProvider` instance using the `provider` argument to configure advanced client options, such as setting a custom `base_url`.

This is useful if you're using a custom-compatible endpoint with the Google Generative Language API.

```python
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import HttpOptions

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.google import GoogleProvider

client = genai.Client(
    api_key='gemini-custom-api-key',
    http_options=HttpOptions(base_url='gemini-custom-base-url'),
)
provider = GoogleProvider(client=client)
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash', provider=provider)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Model Settings

You can customize model behavior using GoogleModelSettings:

```python
from google.genai.types import HarmBlockThreshold, HarmCategory

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel, GoogleModelSettings

settings = GoogleModelSettings(
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=1024,
    google_thinking_config={'thinking_budget': 2048},
    google_safety_settings=[
        {
            'category': HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,
            'threshold': HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
        }
    ]
)
model = GoogleModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=settings)
...

```

See the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings) for more on safety settings, and [thinking config](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking).

## Document, Image, Audio, and Video Input

`GoogleModel` supports multi-modal input, including documents, images, audio, and video. See the [input documentation](../../input/) for details and examples.

## Model settings

You can use the GoogleModelSettings class to customize the model request.

### Disable thinking

You can disable thinking by setting the `thinking_budget` to `0` on the `google_thinking_config`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel, GoogleModelSettings

model_settings = GoogleModelSettings(google_thinking_config={'thinking_budget': 0})
model = GoogleModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=model_settings)
...

```

Check out the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) for more on thinking.

### Safety settings

You can customize the safety settings by setting the `google_safety_settings` field.

```python
from google.genai.types import HarmBlockThreshold, HarmCategory

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel, GoogleModelSettings

model_settings = GoogleModelSettings(
    google_safety_settings=[
        {
            'category': HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,
            'threshold': HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
        }
    ]
)
model = GoogleModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(model, model_settings=model_settings)
...

```

See the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings) for more on safety settings.

# Groq

## Install

To use `GroqModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `groq` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[groq]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[groq]"

```

## Configuration

To use [Groq](https://groq.com/) through their API, go to [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.

`GroqModelName` contains a list of available Groq models.

## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `GroqModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('groq:llama-3.3-70b-versatile')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel

model = GroqModel('llama-3.3-70b-versatile')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `Provider` via the `provider` argument:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.groq import GroqProvider

model = GroqModel(
    'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', provider=GroqProvider(api_key='your-api-key')
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize the `GroqProvider` with a custom `httpx.AsyncHTTPClient`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.groq import GroqModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.groq import GroqProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = GroqModel(
    'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
    provider=GroqProvider(api_key='your-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an AI platform with all major open source models, datasets, MCPs, and demos. You can use [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers) to run open source models like DeepSeek R1 on scalable serverless infrastructure.

## Install

To use `HuggingFaceModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `huggingface` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[huggingface]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[huggingface]"

```

## Configuration

To use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) inference, you'll need to set up an account which will give you [free tier](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/pricing) allowance on [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers). To setup inference, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and sign up for an account.
1. Create a new access token in [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
1. Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you just created.

Once you have a Hugging Face access token, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN='hf_token'

```

## Usage

You can then use HuggingFaceModel by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('huggingface:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel

model = HuggingFaceModel('Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

By default, the HuggingFaceModel uses the HuggingFaceProvider that will select automatically the first of the inference providers (Cerebras, Together AI, Cohere..etc) available for the model, sorted by your preferred order in https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers.

## Configure the provider

If you want to pass parameters in code to the provider, you can programmatically instantiate the HuggingFaceProvider and pass it to the model:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface import HuggingFaceProvider

model = HuggingFaceModel('Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B', provider=HuggingFaceProvider(api_key='hf_token', provider_name='nebius'))
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Custom Hugging Face client

HuggingFaceProvider also accepts a custom [`AsyncInferenceClient`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.29.3/en/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.AsyncInferenceClient) client via the `hf_client` parameter, so you can customise the `headers`, `bill_to` (billing to an HF organization you're a member of), `base_url` etc. as defined in the [Hugging Face Hub python library docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/inference_client).

```python
from huggingface_hub import AsyncInferenceClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface import HuggingFaceProvider

client = AsyncInferenceClient(
    bill_to='openai',
    api_key='hf_token',
    provider='fireworks-ai',
)

model = HuggingFaceModel(
    'Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B',
    provider=HuggingFaceProvider(hf_client=client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# Mistral

## Install

To use `MistralModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `mistral` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[mistral]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[mistral]"

```

## Configuration

To use [Mistral](https://mistral.ai) through their API, go to [console.mistral.ai/api-keys/](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.

`LatestMistralModelNames` contains a list of the most popular Mistral models.

## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `MistralModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('mistral:mistral-large-latest')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.mistral import MistralModel

model = MistralModel('mistral-small-latest')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## `provider` argument

You can provide a custom `Provider` via the `provider` argument:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.mistral import MistralModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.mistral import MistralProvider

model = MistralModel(
    'mistral-large-latest', provider=MistralProvider(api_key='your-api-key', base_url='https://<mistral-provider-endpoint>')
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize the provider with a custom `httpx.AsyncHTTPClient`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.mistral import MistralModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.mistral import MistralProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = MistralModel(
    'mistral-large-latest',
    provider=MistralProvider(api_key='your-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

# OpenAI

## Install

To use OpenAI models or OpenAI-compatible APIs, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `openai` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"

```

## Configuration

To use `OpenAIModel` with the OpenAI API, go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) and follow your nose until you find the place to generate an API key.

## Environment variable

Once you have the API key, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'

```

You can then use `OpenAIModel` by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
...

```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

By default, the `OpenAIModel` uses the `OpenAIProvider` with the `base_url` set to `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

## Configure the provider

If you want to pass parameters in code to the provider, you can programmatically instantiate the OpenAIProvider and pass it to the model:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o', provider=OpenAIProvider(api_key='your-api-key'))
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## Custom OpenAI Client

`OpenAIProvider` also accepts a custom `AsyncOpenAI` client via the `openai_client` parameter, so you can customise the `organization`, `project`, `base_url` etc. as defined in the [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).

custom_openai_client.py

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

client = AsyncOpenAI(max_retries=3)
model = OpenAIModel('gpt-4o', provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=client))
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You could also use the [`AsyncAzureOpenAI`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/switching-endpoints) client to use the Azure OpenAI API. Note that the `AsyncAzureOpenAI` is a subclass of `AsyncOpenAI`.

```python
from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
    azure_endpoint='...',
    api_version='2024-07-01-preview',
    api_key='your-api-key',
)

model = OpenAIModel(
    'gpt-4o',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

## OpenAI Responses API

Pydantic AI also supports OpenAI's [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) through the `OpenAIResponsesModel` class.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIResponsesModel

model = OpenAIResponsesModel('gpt-4o')
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

The Responses API has built-in tools that you can use instead of building your own:

- [Web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search): allow models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- [File search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search): allow models to search your files for relevant information before generating a response.
- [Computer use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use): allow models to use a computer to perform tasks on your behalf.

You can use the `OpenAIResponsesModelSettings` class to make use of those built-in tools:

```python
from openai.types.responses import WebSearchToolParam  # (1)!

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIResponsesModel, OpenAIResponsesModelSettings

model_settings = OpenAIResponsesModelSettings(
    openai_builtin_tools=[WebSearchToolParam(type='web_search_preview')],
)
model = OpenAIResponsesModel('gpt-4o')
agent = Agent(model=model, model_settings=model_settings)

result = agent.run_sync('What is the weather in Tokyo?')
print(result.output)
"""
As of 7:48 AM on Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Tokyo, Japan, the weather is cloudy with a temperature of 53Â°F (12Â°C).
"""

```

1. The file search tool and computer use tool can also be imported from `openai.types.responses`.

You can learn more about the differences between the Responses API and Chat Completions API in the [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions).

## OpenAI-compatible Models

Many providers and models are compatible with the OpenAI API, and can be used with `OpenAIModel` in Pydantic AI. Before getting started, check the [installation and configuration](#install) instructions above.

To use another OpenAI-compatible API, you can make use of the `base_url` and `api_key` arguments from `OpenAIProvider`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'model_name',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(
        base_url='https://<openai-compatible-api-endpoint>.com', api_key='your-api-key'
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

Various providers also have their own provider classes so that you don't need to specify the base URL yourself and you can use the standard `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` environment variable to set the API key. When a provider has its own provider class, you can use the `Agent("<provider>:<model>")` shorthand, e.g. `Agent("deepseek:deepseek-chat")` or `Agent("openrouter:google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview")`, instead of building the `OpenAIModel` explicitly. Similarly, you can pass the provider name as a string to the `provider` argument on `OpenAIModel` instead of building instantiating the provider class explicitly.

#### Model Profile

Sometimes, the provider or model you're using will have slightly different requirements than OpenAI's API or models, like having different restrictions on JSON schemas for tool definitions, or not supporting tool definitions to be marked as strict.

When using an alternative provider class provided by Pydantic AI, an appropriate model profile is typically selected automatically based on the model name. If the model you're using is not working correctly out of the box, you can tweak various aspects of how model requests are constructed by providing your own ModelProfile (for behaviors shared among all model classes) or OpenAIModelProfile (for behaviors specific to `OpenAIModel`):

```py
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.profiles._json_schema import InlineDefsJsonSchemaTransformer
from pydantic_ai.profiles.openai import OpenAIModelProfile
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'model_name',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(
        base_url='https://<openai-compatible-api-endpoint>.com', api_key='your-api-key'
    ),
    profile=OpenAIModelProfile(
        json_schema_transformer=InlineDefsJsonSchemaTransformer,  # Supported by any model class on a plain ModelProfile
        openai_supports_strict_tool_definition=False  # Supported by OpenAIModel only, requires OpenAIModelProfile
    )
)
agent = Agent(model)

```

### DeepSeek

To use the [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com) provider, first create an API key by following the [Quick Start guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/). Once you have the API key, you can use it with the DeepSeekProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.deepseek import DeepSeekProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'deepseek-chat',
    provider=DeepSeekProvider(api_key='your-deepseek-api-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also customize any provider with a custom `http_client`:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.deepseek import DeepSeekProvider

custom_http_client = AsyncClient(timeout=30)
model = OpenAIModel(
    'deepseek-chat',
    provider=DeepSeekProvider(
        api_key='your-deepseek-api-key', http_client=custom_http_client
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Ollama

To use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you must first download the Ollama client, and then download a model using the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library).

You must also ensure the Ollama server is running when trying to make requests to it. For more information, please see the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs).

#### Example local usage

With `ollama` installed, you can run the server with the model you want to use:

```bash
ollama run llama3.2

```

(this will pull the `llama3.2` model if you don't already have it downloaded)

Then run your code, here's a minimal example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider


class CityLocation(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str


ollama_model = OpenAIModel(
    model_name='llama3.2', provider=OpenAIProvider(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1')
)
agent = Agent(ollama_model, output_type=CityLocation)

result = agent.run_sync('Where were the olympics held in 2012?')
print(result.output)
#> city='London' country='United Kingdom'
print(result.usage())
#> Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=57, response_tokens=8, total_tokens=65)

```

#### Example using a remote server

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

ollama_model = OpenAIModel(
    model_name='qwen2.5-coder:7b',  # (1)!
    provider=OpenAIProvider(base_url='http://192.168.1.74:11434/v1'),  # (2)!
)


class CityLocation(BaseModel):
    city: str
    country: str


agent = Agent(model=ollama_model, output_type=CityLocation)

result = agent.run_sync('Where were the olympics held in 2012?')
print(result.output)
#> city='London' country='United Kingdom'
print(result.usage())
#> Usage(requests=1, request_tokens=57, response_tokens=8, total_tokens=65)

```

1. The name of the model running on the remote server
1. The url of the remote server

### Azure AI Foundry

If you want to use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) as your provider, you can do so by using the AzureProvider class.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.azure import AzureProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'gpt-4o',
    provider=AzureProvider(
        azure_endpoint='your-azure-endpoint',
        api_version='your-api-version',
        api_key='your-api-key',
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### OpenRouter

To use [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), first create an API key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

Once you have the API key, you can use it with the OpenRouterProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openrouter import OpenRouterProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet',
    provider=OpenRouterProvider(api_key='your-openrouter-api-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Grok (xAI)

Go to [xAI API Console](https://console.x.ai/) and create an API key. Once you have the API key, you can use it with the GrokProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.grok import GrokProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'grok-2-1212',
    provider=GrokProvider(api_key='your-xai-api-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### GitHub Models

To use [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models), you'll need a GitHub personal access token with the `models: read` permission.

Once you have the token, you can use it with the GitHubProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.github import GitHubProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'xai/grok-3-mini',  # GitHub Models uses prefixed model names
    provider=GitHubProvider(api_key='your-github-token'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can also set the `GITHUB_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_API_KEY='your-github-token'

```

GitHub Models supports various model families with different prefixes. You can see the full list on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models) or the public [catalog endpoint](https://models.github.ai/catalog/models).

### Perplexity

Follow the Perplexity [getting started](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started) guide to create an API key. Then, you can query the Perplexity API with the following:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'sonar-pro',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(
        base_url='https://api.perplexity.ai',
        api_key='your-perplexity-api-key',
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Fireworks AI

Go to [Fireworks.AI](https://fireworks.ai/) and create an API key in your account settings. Once you have the API key, you can use it with the FireworksProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.fireworks import FireworksProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'accounts/fireworks/models/qwq-32b',  # model library available at https://fireworks.ai/models
    provider=FireworksProvider(api_key='your-fireworks-api-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Together AI

Go to [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai/) and create an API key in your account settings. Once you have the API key, you can use it with the TogetherProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.together import TogetherProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free',  # model library available at https://www.together.ai/models
    provider=TogetherProvider(api_key='your-together-api-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

### Heroku AI

To use [Heroku AI](https://www.heroku.com/ai), you can use the HerokuProvider:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.heroku import HerokuProvider

model = OpenAIModel(
    'claude-3-7-sonnet',
    provider=HerokuProvider(api_key='your-heroku-inference-key'),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

You can set the `HEROKU_INFERENCE_KEY` and `HEROKU_INFERENCE_URL` environment variables to set the API key and base URL, respectively:

```bash
export HEROKU_INFERENCE_KEY='your-heroku-inference-key'
export HEROKU_INFERENCE_URL='https://us.inference.heroku.com'

```
# Graphs

# Graphs

Don't use a nail gun unless you need a nail gun

If Pydantic AI [agents](../agents/) are a hammer, and [multi-agent workflows](../multi-agent-applications/) are a sledgehammer, then graphs are a nail gun:

- sure, nail guns look cooler than hammers
- but nail guns take a lot more setup than hammers
- and nail guns don't make you a better builder, they make you a builder with a nail gun
- Lastly, (and at the risk of torturing this metaphor), if you're a fan of medieval tools like mallets and untyped Python, you probably won't like nail guns or our approach to graphs. (But then again, if you're not a fan of type hints in Python, you've probably already bounced off Pydantic AI to use one of the toy agent frameworks â€” good luck, and feel free to borrow my sledgehammer when you realize you need it)

In short, graphs are a powerful tool, but they're not the right tool for every job. Please consider other [multi-agent approaches](../multi-agent-applications/) before proceeding.

If you're not confident a graph-based approach is a good idea, it might be unnecessary.

Graphs and finite state machines (FSMs) are a powerful abstraction to model, execute, control and visualize complex workflows.

Alongside Pydantic AI, we've developed `pydantic-graph` â€” an async graph and state machine library for Python where nodes and edges are defined using type hints.

While this library is developed as part of Pydantic AI; it has no dependency on `pydantic-ai` and can be considered as a pure graph-based state machine library. You may find it useful whether or not you're using Pydantic AI or even building with GenAI.

`pydantic-graph` is designed for advanced users and makes heavy use of Python generics and type hints. It is not designed to be as beginner-friendly as Pydantic AI.

## Installation

`pydantic-graph` is a required dependency of `pydantic-ai`, and an optional dependency of `pydantic-ai-slim`, see [installation instructions](../install/#slim-install) for more information. You can also install it directly:

```bash
pip install pydantic-graph

```

## Graph Types

`pydantic-graph` is made up of a few key components:

### GraphRunContext

GraphRunContext â€” The context for the graph run, similar to Pydantic AI's RunContext. This holds the state of the graph and dependencies and is passed to nodes when they're run.

`GraphRunContext` is generic in the state type of the graph it's used in, StateT.

### End

End â€” return value to indicate the graph run should end.

`End` is generic in the graph return type of the graph it's used in, RunEndT.

### Nodes

Subclasses of BaseNode define nodes for execution in the graph.

Nodes, which are generally dataclasses, generally consist of:

- fields containing any parameters required/optional when calling the node
- the business logic to execute the node, in the run method
- return annotations of the run method, which are read by `pydantic-graph` to determine the outgoing edges of the node

Nodes are generic in:

- **state**, which must have the same type as the state of graphs they're included in, StateT has a default of `None`, so if you're not using state you can omit this generic parameter, see [stateful graphs](#stateful-graphs) for more information
- **deps**, which must have the same type as the deps of the graph they're included in, DepsT has a default of `None`, so if you're not using deps you can omit this generic parameter, see [dependency injection](#dependency-injection) for more information
- **graph return type** â€” this only applies if the node returns End. RunEndT has a default of Never so this generic parameter can be omitted if the node doesn't return `End`, but must be included if it does.

Here's an example of a start or intermediate node in a graph â€” it can't end the run as it doesn't return End:

intermediate_node.py

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class MyNode(BaseNode[MyState]):  # (1)!
    foo: int  # (2)!

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[MyState],  # (3)!
    ) -> AnotherNode:  # (4)!
        ...
        return AnotherNode()

```

1. State in this example is `MyState` (not shown), hence `BaseNode` is parameterized with `MyState`. This node can't end the run, so the `RunEndT` generic parameter is omitted and defaults to `Never`.
1. `MyNode` is a dataclass and has a single field `foo`, an `int`.
1. The `run` method takes a `GraphRunContext` parameter, again parameterized with state `MyState`.
1. The return type of the `run` method is `AnotherNode` (not shown), this is used to determine the outgoing edges of the node.

We could extend `MyNode` to optionally end the run if `foo` is divisible by 5:

intermediate_or_end_node.py

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class MyNode(BaseNode[MyState, None, int]):  # (1)!
    foo: int

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[MyState],
    ) -> AnotherNode | End[int]:  # (2)!
        if self.foo % 5 == 0:
            return End(self.foo)
        else:
            return AnotherNode()

```

1. We parameterize the node with the return type (`int` in this case) as well as state. Because generic parameters are positional-only, we have to include `None` as the second parameter representing deps.
1. The return type of the `run` method is now a union of `AnotherNode` and `End[int]`, this allows the node to end the run if `foo` is divisible by 5.

### Graph

Graph â€” this is the execution graph itself, made up of a set of [node classes](#nodes) (i.e., `BaseNode` subclasses).

`Graph` is generic in:

- **state** the state type of the graph, StateT
- **deps** the deps type of the graph, DepsT
- **graph return type** the return type of the graph run, RunEndT

Here's an example of a simple graph:

graph_example.py

```py
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, Graph, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class DivisibleBy5(BaseNode[None, None, int]):  # (1)!
    foo: int

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext,
    ) -> Increment | End[int]:
        if self.foo % 5 == 0:
            return End(self.foo)
        else:
            return Increment(self.foo)


@dataclass
class Increment(BaseNode):  # (2)!
    foo: int

    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext) -> DivisibleBy5:
        return DivisibleBy5(self.foo + 1)


fives_graph = Graph(nodes=[DivisibleBy5, Increment])  # (3)!
result = fives_graph.run_sync(DivisibleBy5(4))  # (4)!
print(result.output)
#> 5

```

1. The `DivisibleBy5` node is parameterized with `None` for the state param and `None` for the deps param as this graph doesn't use state or deps, and `int` as it can end the run.
1. The `Increment` node doesn't return `End`, so the `RunEndT` generic parameter is omitted, state can also be omitted as the graph doesn't use state.
1. The graph is created with a sequence of nodes.
1. The graph is run synchronously with run_sync. The initial node is `DivisibleBy5(4)`. Because the graph doesn't use external state or deps, we don't pass `state` or `deps`.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+)*

A [mermaid diagram](#mermaid-diagrams) for this graph can be generated with the following code:

graph_example_diagram.py

```py
from graph_example import DivisibleBy5, fives_graph

fives_graph.mermaid_code(start_node=DivisibleBy5)

```

```
---
title: fives_graph
---
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> DivisibleBy5
  DivisibleBy5 --> Increment
  DivisibleBy5 --> [*]
  Increment --> DivisibleBy5
```

In order to visualize a graph within a `jupyter-notebook`, `IPython.display` needs to be used:

jupyter_display_mermaid.py

```python
from graph_example import DivisibleBy5, fives_graph
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(fives_graph.mermaid_image(start_node=DivisibleBy5)))

```

## Stateful Graphs

The "state" concept in `pydantic-graph` provides an optional way to access and mutate an object (often a `dataclass` or Pydantic model) as nodes run in a graph. If you think of Graphs as a production line, then your state is the engine being passed along the line and built up by each node as the graph is run.

`pydantic-graph` provides state persistence, with the state recorded after each node is run. (See [State Persistence](#state-persistence).)

Here's an example of a graph which represents a vending machine where the user may insert coins and select a product to purchase.

vending_machine.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass

from rich.prompt import Prompt

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, Graph, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class MachineState:  # (1)!
    user_balance: float = 0.0
    product: str | None = None


@dataclass
class InsertCoin(BaseNode[MachineState]):  # (3)!
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[MachineState]) -> CoinsInserted:  # (16)!
        return CoinsInserted(float(Prompt.ask('Insert coins')))  # (4)!


@dataclass
class CoinsInserted(BaseNode[MachineState]):
    amount: float  # (5)!

    async def run(
        self, ctx: GraphRunContext[MachineState]
    ) -> SelectProduct | Purchase:  # (17)!
        ctx.state.user_balance += self.amount  # (6)!
        if ctx.state.product is not None:  # (7)!
            return Purchase(ctx.state.product)
        else:
            return SelectProduct()


@dataclass
class SelectProduct(BaseNode[MachineState]):
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[MachineState]) -> Purchase:
        return Purchase(Prompt.ask('Select product'))


PRODUCT_PRICES = {  # (2)!
    'water': 1.25,
    'soda': 1.50,
    'crisps': 1.75,
    'chocolate': 2.00,
}


@dataclass
class Purchase(BaseNode[MachineState, None, None]):  # (18)!
    product: str

    async def run(
        self, ctx: GraphRunContext[MachineState]
    ) -> End | InsertCoin | SelectProduct:
        if price := PRODUCT_PRICES.get(self.product):  # (8)!
            ctx.state.product = self.product  # (9)!
            if ctx.state.user_balance >= price:  # (10)!
                ctx.state.user_balance -= price
                return End(None)
            else:
                diff = price - ctx.state.user_balance
                print(f'Not enough money for {self.product}, need {diff:0.2f} more')
                #> Not enough money for crisps, need 0.75 more
                return InsertCoin()  # (11)!
        else:
            print(f'No such product: {self.product}, try again')
            return SelectProduct()  # (12)!


vending_machine_graph = Graph(  # (13)!
    nodes=[InsertCoin, CoinsInserted, SelectProduct, Purchase]
)


async def main():
    state = MachineState()  # (14)!
    await vending_machine_graph.run(InsertCoin(), state=state)  # (15)!
    print(f'purchase successful item={state.product} change={state.user_balance:0.2f}')
    #> purchase successful item=crisps change=0.25

```

1. The state of the vending machine is defined as a dataclass with the user's balance and the product they've selected, if any.
1. A dictionary of products mapped to prices.
1. The `InsertCoin` node, BaseNode is parameterized with `MachineState` as that's the state used in this graph.
1. The `InsertCoin` node prompts the user to insert coins. We keep things simple by just entering a monetary amount as a float. Before you start thinking this is a toy too since it's using rich's Prompt.ask within nodes, see [below](#example-human-in-the-loop) for how control flow can be managed when nodes require external input.
1. The `CoinsInserted` node; again this is a dataclass with one field `amount`.
1. Update the user's balance with the amount inserted.
1. If the user has already selected a product, go to `Purchase`, otherwise go to `SelectProduct`.
1. In the `Purchase` node, look up the price of the product if the user entered a valid product.
1. If the user did enter a valid product, set the product in the state so we don't revisit `SelectProduct`.
1. If the balance is enough to purchase the product, adjust the balance to reflect the purchase and return End to end the graph. We're not using the run return type, so we call `End` with `None`.
1. If the balance is insufficient, go to `InsertCoin` to prompt the user to insert more coins.
1. If the product is invalid, go to `SelectProduct` to prompt the user to select a product again.
1. The graph is created by passing a list of nodes to Graph. Order of nodes is not important, but it can affect how [diagrams](#mermaid-diagrams) are displayed.
1. Initialize the state. This will be passed to the graph run and mutated as the graph runs.
1. Run the graph with the initial state. Since the graph can be run from any node, we must pass the start node â€” in this case, `InsertCoin`. Graph.run returns a GraphRunResult that provides the final data and a history of the run.
1. The return type of the node's run method is important as it is used to determine the outgoing edges of the node. This information in turn is used to render [mermaid diagrams](#mermaid-diagrams) and is enforced at runtime to detect misbehavior as soon as possible.
1. The return type of `CoinsInserted`'s run method is a union, meaning multiple outgoing edges are possible.
1. Unlike other nodes, `Purchase` can end the run, so the RunEndT generic parameter must be set. In this case it's `None` since the graph run return type is `None`.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

A [mermaid diagram](#mermaid-diagrams) for this graph can be generated with the following code:

vending_machine_diagram.py

```py
from vending_machine import InsertCoin, vending_machine_graph

vending_machine_graph.mermaid_code(start_node=InsertCoin)

```

The diagram generated by the above code is:

```
---
title: vending_machine_graph
---
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> InsertCoin
  InsertCoin --> CoinsInserted
  CoinsInserted --> SelectProduct
  CoinsInserted --> Purchase
  SelectProduct --> Purchase
  Purchase --> InsertCoin
  Purchase --> SelectProduct
  Purchase --> [*]
```

See [below](#mermaid-diagrams) for more information on generating diagrams.

## GenAI Example

So far we haven't shown an example of a Graph that actually uses Pydantic AI or GenAI at all.

In this example, one agent generates a welcome email to a user and the other agent provides feedback on the email.

This graph has a very simple structure:

```
---
title: feedback_graph
---
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> WriteEmail
  WriteEmail --> Feedback
  Feedback --> WriteEmail
  Feedback --> [*]
```

genai_email_feedback.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations as _annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass, field

from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

from pydantic_ai import Agent, format_as_xml
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage
from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, Graph, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    interests: list[str]


@dataclass
class Email:
    subject: str
    body: str


@dataclass
class State:
    user: User
    write_agent_messages: list[ModelMessage] = field(default_factory=list)


email_writer_agent = Agent(
    'google-vertex:gemini-1.5-pro',
    output_type=Email,
    system_prompt='Write a welcome email to our tech blog.',
)


@dataclass
class WriteEmail(BaseNode[State]):
    email_feedback: str | None = None

    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[State]) -> Feedback:
        if self.email_feedback:
            prompt = (
                f'Rewrite the email for the user:\n'
                f'{format_as_xml(ctx.state.user)}\n'
                f'Feedback: {self.email_feedback}'
            )
        else:
            prompt = (
                f'Write a welcome email for the user:\n'
                f'{format_as_xml(ctx.state.user)}'
            )

        result = await email_writer_agent.run(
            prompt,
            message_history=ctx.state.write_agent_messages,
        )
        ctx.state.write_agent_messages += result.new_messages()
        return Feedback(result.output)


class EmailRequiresWrite(BaseModel):
    feedback: str


class EmailOk(BaseModel):
    pass


feedback_agent = Agent[None, EmailRequiresWrite | EmailOk](
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    output_type=EmailRequiresWrite | EmailOk,  # type: ignore
    system_prompt=(
        'Review the email and provide feedback, email must reference the users specific interests.'
    ),
)


@dataclass
class Feedback(BaseNode[State, None, Email]):
    email: Email

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[State],
    ) -> WriteEmail | End[Email]:
        prompt = format_as_xml({'user': ctx.state.user, 'email': self.email})
        result = await feedback_agent.run(prompt)
        if isinstance(result.output, EmailRequiresWrite):
            return WriteEmail(email_feedback=result.output.feedback)
        else:
            return End(self.email)


async def main():
    user = User(
        name='John Doe',
        email='john.joe@example.com',
        interests=['Haskel', 'Lisp', 'Fortran'],
    )
    state = State(user)
    feedback_graph = Graph(nodes=(WriteEmail, Feedback))
    result = await feedback_graph.run(WriteEmail(), state=state)
    print(result.output)
    """
    Email(
        subject='Welcome to our tech blog!',
        body='Hello John, Welcome to our tech blog! ...',
    )
    """

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

## Iterating Over a Graph

### Using `Graph.iter` for `async for` iteration

Sometimes you want direct control or insight into each node as the graph executes. The easiest way to do that is with the Graph.iter method, which returns a **context manager** that yields a GraphRun object. The `GraphRun` is an async-iterable over the nodes of your graph, allowing you to record or modify them as they execute.

Here's an example:

count_down.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations as _annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass
from pydantic_graph import Graph, BaseNode, End, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class CountDownState:
    counter: int


@dataclass
class CountDown(BaseNode[CountDownState, None, int]):
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[CountDownState]) -> CountDown | End[int]:
        if ctx.state.counter <= 0:
            return End(ctx.state.counter)
        ctx.state.counter -= 1
        return CountDown()


count_down_graph = Graph(nodes=[CountDown])


async def main():
    state = CountDownState(counter=3)
    async with count_down_graph.iter(CountDown(), state=state) as run:  # (1)!
        async for node in run:  # (2)!
            print('Node:', node)
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: End(data=0)
    print('Final output:', run.result.output)  # (3)!
    #> Final output: 0

```

1. `Graph.iter(...)` returns a GraphRun.
1. Here, we step through each node as it is executed.
1. Once the graph returns an End, the loop ends, and `run.result` becomes a GraphRunResult containing the final outcome (`0` here).

### Using `GraphRun.next(node)` manually

Alternatively, you can drive iteration manually with the GraphRun.next method, which allows you to pass in whichever node you want to run next. You can modify or selectively skip nodes this way.

Below is a contrived example that stops whenever the counter is at 2, ignoring any node runs beyond that:

count_down_next.py

```python
from pydantic_graph import End, FullStatePersistence
from count_down import CountDown, CountDownState, count_down_graph


async def main():
    state = CountDownState(counter=5)
    persistence = FullStatePersistence()  # (7)!
    async with count_down_graph.iter(
        CountDown(), state=state, persistence=persistence
    ) as run:
        node = run.next_node  # (1)!
        while not isinstance(node, End):  # (2)!
            print('Node:', node)
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            #> Node: CountDown()
            if state.counter == 2:
                break  # (3)!
            node = await run.next(node)  # (4)!

        print(run.result)  # (5)!
        #> None

        for step in persistence.history:  # (6)!
            print('History Step:', step.state, step.state)
            #> History Step: CountDownState(counter=5) CountDownState(counter=5)
            #> History Step: CountDownState(counter=4) CountDownState(counter=4)
            #> History Step: CountDownState(counter=3) CountDownState(counter=3)
            #> History Step: CountDownState(counter=2) CountDownState(counter=2)

```

1. We start by grabbing the first node that will be run in the agent's graph.
1. The agent run is finished once an `End` node has been produced; instances of `End` cannot be passed to `next`.
1. If the user decides to stop early, we break out of the loop. The graph run won't have a real final result in that case (`run.result` remains `None`).
1. At each step, we call `await run.next(node)` to run it and get the next node (or an `End`).
1. Because we did not continue the run until it finished, the `result` is not set.
1. The run's history is still populated with the steps we executed so far.
1. Use FullStatePersistence so we can show the history of the run, see [State Persistence](#state-persistence) below for more information.

## State Persistence

One of the biggest benefits of finite state machine (FSM) graphs is how they simplify the handling of interrupted execution. This might happen for a variety of reasons:

- the state machine logic might fundamentally need to be paused â€” e.g. the returns workflow for an e-commerce order needs to wait for the item to be posted to the returns center or because execution of the next node needs input from a user so needs to wait for a new http request,
- the execution takes so long that the entire graph can't reliably be executed in a single continuous run â€” e.g. a deep research agent that might take hours to run,
- you want to run multiple graph nodes in parallel in different processes / hardware instances (note: parallel node execution is not yet supported in `pydantic-graph`, see [#704](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/704)).

Trying to make a conventional control flow (i.e., boolean logic and nested function calls) implementation compatible with these usage scenarios generally results in brittle and over-complicated spaghetti code, with the logic required to interrupt and resume execution dominating the implementation.

To allow graph runs to be interrupted and resumed, `pydantic-graph` provides state persistence â€” a system for snapshotting the state of a graph run before and after each node is run, allowing a graph run to be resumed from any point in the graph.

`pydantic-graph` includes three state persistence implementations:

- SimpleStatePersistence â€” Simple in memory state persistence that just hold the latest snapshot. If no state persistence implementation is provided when running a graph, this is used by default.
- FullStatePersistence â€” In memory state persistence that hold a list of snapshots.
- FileStatePersistence â€” File-based state persistence that saves snapshots to a JSON file.

In production applications, developers should implement their own state persistence by subclassing BaseStatePersistence abstract base class, which might persist runs in a relational database like PostgresQL.

At a high level the role of `StatePersistence` implementations is to store and retrieve NodeSnapshot and EndSnapshot objects.

graph.iter_from_persistence() may be used to run the graph based on the state stored in persistence.

We can run the `count_down_graph` from [above](#iterating-over-a-graph), using graph.iter_from_persistence() and FileStatePersistence.

As you can see in this code, `run_node` requires no external application state (apart from state persistence) to be run, meaning graphs can easily be executed by distributed execution and queueing systems.

count_down_from_persistence.py

```python
from pathlib import Path

from pydantic_graph import End
from pydantic_graph.persistence.file import FileStatePersistence

from count_down import CountDown, CountDownState, count_down_graph


async def main():
    run_id = 'run_abc123'
    persistence = FileStatePersistence(Path(f'count_down_{run_id}.json'))  # (1)!
    state = CountDownState(counter=5)
    await count_down_graph.initialize(  # (2)!
        CountDown(), state=state, persistence=persistence
    )

    done = False
    while not done:
        done = await run_node(run_id)


async def run_node(run_id: str) -> bool:  # (3)!
    persistence = FileStatePersistence(Path(f'count_down_{run_id}.json'))
    async with count_down_graph.iter_from_persistence(persistence) as run:  # (4)!
        node_or_end = await run.next()  # (5)!

    print('Node:', node_or_end)
    #> Node: CountDown()
    #> Node: CountDown()
    #> Node: CountDown()
    #> Node: CountDown()
    #> Node: CountDown()
    #> Node: End(data=0)
    return isinstance(node_or_end, End)  # (6)!

```

1. Create a FileStatePersistence to use to start the graph.
1. Call graph.initialize() to set the initial graph state in the persistence object.
1. `run_node` is a pure function that doesn't need access to any other process state to run the next node of the graph, except the ID of the run.
1. Call graph.iter_from_persistence() create a GraphRun object that will run the next node of the graph from the state stored in persistence. This will return either a node or an `End` object.
1. graph.run() will return either a node or an End object.
1. Check if the node is an End object, if it is, the graph run is complete.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

### Example: Human in the loop.

As noted above, state persistence allows graphs to be interrupted and resumed. One use case of this is to allow user input to continue.

In this example, an AI asks the user a question, the user provides an answer, the AI evaluates the answer and ends if the user got it right or asks another question if they got it wrong.

Instead of running the entire graph in a single process invocation, we run the graph by running the process repeatedly, optionally providing an answer to the question as a command line argument.

`ai_q_and_a_graph.py` â€” `question_graph` definition

ai_q_and_a_graph.py

```python

1. Get the user's answer from the command line, if provided. See [question graph example](../examples/question-graph/) for a complete example.
1. Create a state persistence instance the `'question_graph.json'` file may or may not already exist.
1. Since we're using the persistence interface outside a graph, we need to call set_graph_types to set the graph generic types `StateT` and `RunEndT` for the persistence instance. This is necessary to allow the persistence instance to know how to serialize and deserialize graph nodes.
1. If we're run the graph before, load_next will return a snapshot of the next node to run, here we use `state` from that snapshot, and create a new `Evaluate` node with the answer provided on the command line.
1. If the graph hasn't been run before, we create a new `QuestionState` and start with the `Ask` node.
1. Call GraphRun.next() to run the node. This will return either a node or an `End` object.
1. If the node is an `End` object, the graph run is complete. The `data` field of the `End` object contains the comment returned by the `evaluate_agent` about the correct answer.
1. To demonstrate the state persistence, we call load_all to get all the snapshots from the persistence instance. This will return a list of Snapshot objects.
1. If the node is an `Answer` object, we print the question and break out of the loop to end the process and wait for user input.

## Dependency Injection

As with Pydantic AI, `pydantic-graph` supports dependency injection via a generic parameter on Graph and BaseNode, and the GraphRunContext.deps field.

As an example of dependency injection, let's modify the `DivisibleBy5` example [above](#graph) to use a ProcessPoolExecutor to run the compute load in a separate process (this is a contrived example, `ProcessPoolExecutor` wouldn't actually improve performance in this example):

deps_example.py

```py
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, FullStatePersistence, Graph, GraphRunContext


@dataclass
class GraphDeps:
    executor: ProcessPoolExecutor


@dataclass
class DivisibleBy5(BaseNode[None, GraphDeps, int]):
    foo: int

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[None, GraphDeps],
    ) -> Increment | End[int]:
        if self.foo % 5 == 0:
            return End(self.foo)
        else:
            return Increment(self.foo)


@dataclass
class Increment(BaseNode[None, GraphDeps]):
    foo: int

    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[None, GraphDeps]) -> DivisibleBy5:
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        compute_result = await loop.run_in_executor(
            ctx.deps.executor,
            self.compute,
        )
        return DivisibleBy5(compute_result)

    def compute(self) -> int:
        return self.foo + 1


fives_graph = Graph(nodes=[DivisibleBy5, Increment])


async def main():
    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        deps = GraphDeps(executor)
        result = await fives_graph.run(DivisibleBy5(3), deps=deps, persistence=FullStatePersistence())
    print(result.output)
    #> 5
    # the full history is quite verbose (see below), so we'll just print the summary
    print([item.node for item in result.persistence.history])
    """
    [
        DivisibleBy5(foo=3),
        Increment(foo=3),
        DivisibleBy5(foo=4),
        Increment(foo=4),
        DivisibleBy5(foo=5),
        End(data=5),
    ]
    """

```

## Mermaid Diagrams

Pydantic Graph can generate [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) [`stateDiagram-v2`](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/stateDiagram.html) diagrams for graphs, as shown above.

These diagrams can be generated with:

- Graph.mermaid_code to generate the mermaid code for a graph
- Graph.mermaid_image to generate an image of the graph using [mermaid.ink](https://mermaid.ink/)
- Graph.mermaid_save to generate an image of the graph using [mermaid.ink](https://mermaid.ink/) and save it to a file

Beyond the diagrams shown above, you can also customize mermaid diagrams with the following options:

- Edge allows you to apply a label to an edge
- BaseNode.docstring_notes and BaseNode.get_note allows you to add notes to nodes
- The highlighted_nodes parameter allows you to highlight specific node(s) in the diagram

Putting that together, we can edit the last [`ai_q_and_a_graph.py`](#example-human-in-the-loop) example to:

- add labels to some edges
- add a note to the `Ask` node
- highlight the `Answer` node
- save the diagram as a `PNG` image to file

ai_q_and_a_graph_extra.py

```python

evaluate_agent = Agent(

    output_type=EvaluationResult,
    system_prompt='Given a question and answer, evaluate if the answer is correct.',
)


@dataclass
class Evaluate(BaseNode[QuestionState, None, str]):
    answer: str

    async def run(
        self,
        ctx: GraphRunContext[QuestionState],
    ) -> Annotated[End[str], Edge(label='success')] | Reprimand:
        assert ctx.state.question is not None
        result = await evaluate_agent.run(
            format_as_xml({'question': ctx.state.question, 'answer': self.answer}),
            message_history=ctx.state.evaluate_agent_messages,
        )
        ctx.state.evaluate_agent_messages += result.new_messages()
        if result.output.correct:
            return End(result.output.comment)
        else:
            return Reprimand(result.output.comment)


@dataclass
class Reprimand(BaseNode[QuestionState]):
    comment: str

    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext[QuestionState]) -> Ask:
        print(f'Comment: {self.comment}')
        ctx.state.question = None
        return Ask()


question_graph = Graph(
    nodes=(Ask, Answer, Evaluate, Reprimand), state_type=QuestionState
)

```

*(This example is not complete and cannot be run directly)*

This would generate an image that looks like this:

```

  note right of Ask
    Judge the answer.
    Decide on next step.
  end note
  Answer --> Evaluate
  Evaluate --> Reprimand
  Evaluate --> [*]: success
  Reprimand --> Ask

classDef highlighted fill:#fdff32
class Answer highlighted
```

### Setting Direction of the State Diagram

You can specify the direction of the state diagram using one of the following values:

- `'TB'`: Top to bottom, the diagram flows vertically from top to bottom.
- `'LR'`: Left to right, the diagram flows horizontally from left to right.
- `'RL'`: Right to left, the diagram flows horizontally from right to left.
- `'BT'`: Bottom to top, the diagram flows vertically from bottom to top.

Here is an example of how to do this using 'Left to Right' (LR) instead of the default 'Top to Bottom' (TB):

vending_machine_diagram.py

```py
from vending_machine import InsertCoin, vending_machine_graph

vending_machine_graph.mermaid_code(start_node=InsertCoin, direction='LR')

```

```
---
title: vending_machine_graph
---
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  [*] --> InsertCoin
  InsertCoin --> CoinsInserted
  CoinsInserted --> SelectProduct
  CoinsInserted --> Purchase
  SelectProduct --> Purchase
  Purchase --> InsertCoin
  Purchase --> SelectProduct
  Purchase --> [*]
```

### Agent

Bases: `Generic[AgentDepsT, OutputDataT]`

Class for defining "agents" - a way to have a specific type of "conversation" with an LLM.

Agents are generic in the dependency type they take AgentDepsT and the output type they return, OutputDataT.

By default, if neither generic parameter is customised, agents have type `Agent[None, str]`.

Minimal usage example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

                defaults to `str`.
            instructions: Instructions to use for this agent, you can also register instructions via a function with
                [`instructions`][pydantic_ai.Agent.instructions].
            system_prompt: Static system prompts to use for this agent, you can also register system
                prompts via a function with [`system_prompt`][pydantic_ai.Agent.system_prompt].
            deps_type: The type used for dependency injection, this parameter exists solely to allow you to fully
                parameterize the agent, and therefore get the best out of static type checking.
                If you're not using deps, but want type checking to pass, you can set `deps=None` to satisfy Pyright
                or add a type hint `: Agent[None, <return type>]`.
            name: The name of the agent, used for logging. If `None`, we try to infer the agent name from the call frame
                when the agent is first run.
            model_settings: Optional model request settings to use for this agent's runs, by default.
            retries: The default number of retries to allow before raising an error.
            output_retries: The maximum number of retries to allow for output validation, defaults to `retries`.
            tools: Tools to register with the agent, you can also register tools via the decorators
                [`@agent.tool`][pydantic_ai.Agent.tool] and [`@agent.tool_plain`][pydantic_ai.Agent.tool_plain].
            prepare_tools: Custom function to prepare the tool definition of all tools for each step, except output tools.
                This is useful if you want to customize the definition of multiple tools or you want to register
                a subset of tools for a given step. See [`ToolsPrepareFunc`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolsPrepareFunc]
            prepare_output_tools: Custom function to prepare the tool definition of all output tools for each step.
                This is useful if you want to customize the definition of multiple output tools or you want to register
                a subset of output tools for a given step. See [`ToolsPrepareFunc`][pydantic_ai.tools.ToolsPrepareFunc]
            toolsets: Toolsets to register with the agent, including MCP servers.
            defer_model_check: by default, if you provide a [named][pydantic_ai.models.KnownModelName] model,
                it's evaluated to create a [`Model`][pydantic_ai.models.Model] instance immediately,
                which checks for the necessary environment variables. Set this to `false`
                to defer the evaluation until the first run. Useful if you want to
                [override the model][pydantic_ai.Agent.override] for testing.

                See [`EndStrategy`][pydantic_ai.agent.EndStrategy] for more information.
            instrument: Set to True to automatically instrument with OpenTelemetry,
                which will use Logfire if it's configured.
                Set to an instance of [`InstrumentationSettings`][pydantic_ai.agent.InstrumentationSettings] to customize.
                If this isn't set, then the last value set by

        stream of events coming from the execution of tools.

            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional list of toolsets to use for this agent, defaults to the agent's toolset.

            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always
                automatically include two middleware classes. `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very
                outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled
                exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto
                callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_startup: A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not
                take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_shutdown: A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do
                not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform startup and shutdown tasks.
                This is a newer style that replaces the `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or
                the other, not both.

Create an agent.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `model` | `Model | KnownModelName | str | None` | The default model to use for this agent, if not provide, you must provide the model when calling it. We allow str here since the actual list of allowed models changes frequently. | `None` | | `output_type` | `Any` | The type of the output data, used to validate the data returned by the model, defaults to str. | `str` | | `instructions` | `str | SystemPromptFunc[AgentDepsT] | Sequence[str | SystemPromptFunc[AgentDepsT]] | None` | Instructions to use for this agent, you can also register instructions via a function with instructions. | `None` | | `system_prompt` | `str | Sequence[str]` | Static system prompts to use for this agent, you can also register system prompts via a function with system_prompt. | `()` | | `deps_type` | `type[AgentDepsT]` | The type used for dependency injection, this parameter exists solely to allow you to fully parameterize the agent, and therefore get the best out of static type checking. If you're not using deps, but want type checking to pass, you can set deps=None to satisfy Pyright or add a type hint : Agent\[None, <return type>\]. | `NoneType` | | `name` | `str | None` | The name of the agent, used for logging. If None, we try to infer the agent name from the call frame when the agent is first run. | `None` | | `model_settings` | `ModelSettings | None` | Optional model request settings to use for this agent's runs, by default. | `None` | | `retries` | `int` | The default number of retries to allow before raising an error. | `1` | | `output_retries` | `int | None` | The maximum number of retries to allow for output validation, defaults to retries. | `None` | | `tools` | `Sequence[Tool[AgentDepsT] | ToolFuncEither[AgentDepsT, ...]]` | Tools to register with the agent, you can also register tools via the decorators @agent.tool and @agent.tool_plain. | `()` | | `prepare_tools` | `ToolsPrepareFunc[AgentDepsT] | None` | Custom function to prepare the tool definition of all tools for each step, except output tools. This is useful if you want to customize the definition of multiple tools or you want to register a subset of tools for a given step.

This is useful if you want to customize the definition of multiple output tools or you want to register a subset of output tools for a given step. See ToolsPrepareFunc | `None` | | `toolsets` | `Sequence[AbstractToolset[AgentDepsT]] | None` | Toolsets to register with the agent, including MCP servers. | `None` | | `defer_model_check` | `bool` | by default, if you provide a named model, it's evaluated to create a Model instance immediately, which checks for the necessary environment variables. Set this to false to defer the evaluation until the first run. Useful if you want to override the model for testing. | `False` | | `end_strategy` | `EndStrategy` | Strategy for handling tool calls that are requested alongside a final result. See EndStrategy for more information. | `'early'` | | `instrument` | `InstrumentationSettings | bool | None` | Set to True to automatically instrument with OpenTelemetry, which will use Logfire if it's configured. Set to an instance of InstrumentationSettings to customize. If this isn't set, then the last value set by Agent.instrument_all() will be used, which defaults to False. See the Debugging and Monitoring guide for more info. | `None` | | `history_processors` | `Sequence[HistoryProcessor[AgentDepsT]] | None` | Optional list of callables to process the message history before sending it to the model. Each processor takes a list of messages and returns a modified list of messages. Processors can be sync or async and are applied in sequence. | `None` |

    ) = None,
    **_deprecated_kwargs: Never
) -> AgentRunResult[Any]

```

Run the agent with a user prompt in async mode.

This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and result schemas) and then runs the graph to completion. The result of the run is returned.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

async def main():
    agent_run = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
    print(agent_run.output)
    #> Paris

A contextmanager which can be used to iterate over the agent graph's nodes as they are executed.

This method builds an internal agent graph (using system prompts, tools and output schemas) and then returns an `AgentRun` object. The `AgentRun` can be used to async-iterate over the nodes of the graph as they are executed. This is the API to use if you want to consume the outputs coming from each LLM model response, or the stream of events coming from the execution of tools.

The `AgentRun` also provides methods to access the full message history, new messages, and usage statistics, and the final result of the run once it has completed.

For more details, see the documentation of `AgentRun`.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

async def main():
    nodes = []
    async with agent.iter('What is the capital of France?') as agent_run:
        async for node in agent_run:

```

Synchronously run the agent with a user prompt.

This is a convenience method that wraps self.run with `loop.run_until_complete(...)`. You therefore can't use this method inside async code or if there's an active event loop.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

result_sync = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of Italy?')
print(result_sync.output)
#> Rome

```

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `user_prompt` | `str | Sequence[UserContent] | None` | User input to start/continue the conversation. | `None` | | `output_type` | `OutputSpec[RunOutputDataT] | None` | Custom output type to use for this run, output_type may only be used if the agent has no output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type. | `None` | | `message_history` | `list[ModelMessage] | None` | History of the conversation so far. | `None` | | `model` | `Model | KnownModelName | str | None` | Optional model to use for this run, required if model was not set when creating the agent. | `None` | | `deps` | `AgentDepsT` | Optional dependencies to use for this run. | `None` | | `model_settings` | `ModelSettings | None` | Optional settings to use for this model's request. | `None` | | `usage_limits` | `UsageLimits | None` | Optional limits on model request count or token usage. | `None` | | `usage` | `Usage | None` | Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools. | `None` | | `infer_name` | `bool` | Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set. | `True` | | `toolsets` | `Sequence[AbstractToolset[AgentDepsT]] | None` | Optional additional toolsets for this run. | `None` |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `AgentRunResult[Any]` | The result of the run. |

Decorator to register an instructions function.

Optionally takes RunContext as its only argument. Can decorate a sync or async functions.

The decorator can be used bare (`agent.instructions`).

Overloads for every possible signature of `instructions` are included so the decorator doesn't obscure the type of the function.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent('test', deps_type=str)

@agent.instructions
def simple_instructions() -> str:
    return 'foobar'

@agent.instructions
async def async_instructions(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    return f'{ctx.deps} is the best'

```

Decorator to register a tool function which takes RunContext as its first argument.

Can decorate a sync or async functions.

The docstring is inspected to extract both the tool description and description of each parameter, [learn more](../../tools/#function-tools-and-schema).

We can't add overloads for every possible signature of tool, since the return type is a recursive union so the signature of functions decorated with `@agent.tool` is obscured.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

agent = Agent('test', deps_type=int)

@agent.tool
def foobar(ctx: RunContext[int], x: int) -> int:
    return ctx.deps + x

@agent.tool(retries=2)
async def spam(ctx: RunContext[str], y: float) -> float:
    return ctx.deps + y

result = agent.run_sync('foobar', deps=1)
print(result.output)
#> {"foobar":1,"spam":1.0}

This is useful if you want to customise a tool at call time, or omit it completely from a step. See ToolPrepareFunc. | `None` | | `docstring_format` | `DocstringFormat` | The format of the docstring, see DocstringFormat. Defaults to 'auto', such that the format is inferred from the structure of the docstring. | `'auto'` | | `require_parameter_descriptions` | `bool` | If True, raise an error if a parameter description is missing.

Convert the agent to an AG-UI application.

This allows you to use the agent with a compatible AG-UI frontend.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
app = agent.to_ag_ui()

```

The `app` is an ASGI application that can be used with any ASGI server.

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

```

See [AG-UI docs](../../ag-ui/) for more information.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `output_type` | `OutputSpec[OutputDataT] | None` | Custom output type to use for this run, output_type may only be used if the agent has no output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's output type. | `None` | | `model` | `Model | KnownModelName | str | None` | Optional model to use for this run, required if model was not set when creating the agent. | `None` | | `deps` | `AgentDepsT` | Optional dependencies to use for this run. | `None` | | `model_settings` | `ModelSettings | None` | Optional settings to use for this model's request. | `None` | | `usage_limits` | `UsageLimits | None` | Optional limits on model request count or token usage. | `None` | | `usage` | `Usage | None` | Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools. | `None` | | `infer_name` | `bool` | Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set. | `True` | | `toolsets` | `Sequence[AbstractToolset[AgentDepsT]] | None` | Optional list of toolsets to use for this agent, defaults to the agent's toolset. | `None` | | `debug` | `bool` | Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors. | `False` | | `routes` | `Sequence[BaseRoute] | None` | A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests. | `None` | | `middleware` | `Sequence[Middleware] | None` | A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always automatically include two middleware classes. ServerErrorMiddleware is added as the very outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack. ExceptionMiddleware is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints. | `None` | | `exception_handlers` | `Mapping[Any, ExceptionHandler] | None` | A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form handler(request, exc) -> response and may be either standard functions, or async functions. | `None` | | `on_startup` | `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None` | A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions. | `None` | | `on_shutdown` | `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None` | A list of callables to run on application shutdown.

### AgentRun

Bases: `Generic[AgentDepsT, OutputDataT]`

A stateful, async-iterable run of an Agent.

You generally obtain an `AgentRun` instance by calling `async with my_agent.iter(...) as agent_run:`.

Once you have an instance, you can use it to iterate through the run's nodes as they execute. When an End is reached, the run finishes and result becomes available.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

async def main():
    nodes = []
    # Iterate through the run, recording each node along the way:
    async with agent.iter('What is the capital of France?') as agent_run:
        async for node in agent_run:
            nodes.append(node)
    print(nodes)
    '''
    [
        UserPromptNode(
            user_prompt='What is the capital of France?',
            instructions=None,
            instructions_functions=[],
            system_prompts=(),
            system_prompt_functions=[],
            system_prompt_dynamic_functions={},
        ),
        ModelRequestNode(
            request=ModelRequest(
                parts=[
                    UserPromptPart(
                        content='What is the capital of France?',
                        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                    )
                ]
            )
        ),
        CallToolsNode(
            model_response=ModelResponse(
                parts=[TextPart(content='Paris')],
                usage=Usage(
                    requests=1, request_tokens=56, response_tokens=1, total_tokens=57
                ),
                model_name='gpt-4o',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            )
        ),
        End(data=FinalResult(output='Paris')),
    ]
    '''
    print(agent_run.result.output)
    #> Paris

    """A stateful, async-iterable run of an [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent].

    You generally obtain an `AgentRun` instance by calling `async with my_agent.iter(...) as agent_run:`.

    Once you have an instance, you can use it to iterate through the run's nodes as they execute. When an
    [`End`][pydantic_graph.nodes.End] is reached, the run finishes and [`result`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRun.result]
    becomes available.

    Example:
    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

    async def main():
        nodes = []
        # Iterate through the run, recording each node along the way:
        async with agent.iter('What is the capital of France?') as agent_run:
            async for node in agent_run:
                nodes.append(node)

# `pydantic_ai.direct`

Methods for making imperative requests to language models with minimal abstraction.

These methods allow you to make requests to LLMs where the only abstraction is input and output schema translation so you can use all models with the same API.

These methods are thin wrappers around Model implementations.

### model_request

```python
model_request(
    model: Model | KnownModelName | str,
    messages: list[ModelMessage],
    *,
    model_settings: ModelSettings | None = None,
    model_request_parameters: (
        ModelRequestParameters | None
    ) = None,
    instrument: InstrumentationSettings | bool | None = None
) -> ModelResponse

```

Make a non-streamed request to a model.

### PushNotificationConfig

Bases: `TypedDict`

Configuration for push notifications.

A2A supports a secure notification mechanism whereby an agent can notify a client of an update outside of a connected session via a PushNotificationService. Within and across enterprises, it is critical that the agent verifies the identity of the notification service, authenticates itself with the service, and presents an identifier that ties the notification to the executing Task.

The target server of the PushNotificationService should be considered a separate service, and is not guaranteed (or even expected) to be the client directly. This PushNotificationService is responsible for authenticating and authorizing the agent and for proxying the verified notification to the appropriate endpoint (which could be anything from a pub/sub queue, to an email inbox or other service, etc).

For contrived scenarios with isolated client-agent pairs (e.g. local service mesh in a contained VPC, etc.) or isolated environments without enterprise security concerns, the client may choose to simply open a port and act as its own PushNotificationService. Any enterprise implementation will likely have a centralized service that authenticates the remote agents with trusted notification credentials and can handle online/offline scenarios. (This should be thought of similarly to a mobile Push Notification Service).

Source code in `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/fasta2a/schema.py`

) -> str

```

Format a Python object as XML.

This is useful since LLMs often find it easier to read semi-structured data (e.g. examples) as XML, rather than JSON etc.

Supports: `str`, `bytes`, `bytearray`, `bool`, `int`, `float`, `date`, `datetime`, `Mapping`, `Iterable`, `dataclass`, and `BaseModel`.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `obj` | `Any` | Python Object to serialize to XML. | *required* | | `root_tag` | `str | None` | Outer tag to wrap the XML in, use None to omit the outer tag. | `None` | | `item_tag` | `str` | Tag to use for each item in an iterable (e.g. list), this is overridden by the class name for dataclasses and Pydantic models. | `'item'` | | `none_str` | `str` | String to use for None values. | `'null'` | | `indent` | `str | None` | Indentation string to use for pretty printing. | `' '` |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `str` | XML representation of the object. |

Example: format_as_xml_example.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import format_as_xml

print(format_as_xml({'name': 'John', 'height': 6, 'weight': 200}, root_tag='user'))

### MCPServerStdio

Bases: `MCPServer`

Runs an MCP server in a subprocess and communicates with it over stdin/stdout.

This class implements the stdio transport from the MCP specification. See <https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio> for more information.

Note

Using this class as an async context manager will start the server as a subprocess when entering the context, and stop it when exiting the context.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio(  # (1)!
    'deno',
    args=[
        'run',
        '-N',
        '-R=node_modules',
        '-W=node_modules',
        '--node-modules-dir=auto',
        'jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python',
        'stdio',
    ]
)
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])

async def main():
    async with agent:  # (2)!
        ...

```

1. See [MCP Run Python](../../mcp/run-python/) for more information.

### MCPServerSSE

Bases: `_MCPServerHTTP`

An MCP server that connects over streamable HTTP connections.

This class implements the SSE transport from the MCP specification. See <https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse> for more information.

Note

Using this class as an async context manager will create a new pool of HTTP connections to connect to a server which should already be running.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerSSE

server = MCPServerSSE('http://localhost:3001/sse')  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])

async def main():
    async with agent:  # (2)!
        ...

```

1. E.g. you might be connecting to a server run with [`mcp-run-python`](../../mcp/run-python/).
1. This will connect to a server running on `localhost:3001`.

### MCPServerStreamableHTTP

Bases: `_MCPServerHTTP`

An MCP server that connects over HTTP using the Streamable HTTP transport.

This class implements the Streamable HTTP transport from the MCP specification. See <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#streamable-http> for more information.

Note

Using this class as an async context manager will create a new pool of HTTP connections to connect to a server which should already be running.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHTTP

server = MCPServerStreamableHTTP('http://localhost:8000/mcp')  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])

#### stream

```python
stream(
    *, debounce_by: float | None = 0.1
) -> AsyncIterator[OutputDataT]

```

Stream the response as an async iterable.

The pydantic validator for structured data will be called in [partial mode](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev/concepts/experimental/#partial-validation) on each iteration.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `debounce_by` | `float | None` | by how much (if at all) to debounce/group the response chunks by. None means no debouncing. Debouncing is particularly important for long structured responses to reduce the overhead of performing validation as each token is received. | `0.1` |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `AsyncIterator[OutputDataT]` | An async iterable of the response data. |

```

Decorator to register a tool function which takes RunContext as its first argument.

Can decorate a sync or async functions.

The docstring is inspected to extract both the tool description and description of each parameter, [learn more](../../tools/#function-tools-and-schema).

We can't add overloads for every possible signature of tool, since the return type is a recursive union so the signature of functions decorated with `@toolset.tool` is obscured.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.toolsets.function import FunctionToolset

toolset = FunctionToolset()

@toolset.tool
def foobar(ctx: RunContext[int], x: int) -> int:
    return ctx.deps + x

@toolset.tool(retries=2)
async def spam(ctx: RunContext[str], y: float) -> float:
    return ctx.deps + y

agent = Agent('test', toolsets=[toolset], deps_type=int)
result = agent.run_sync('foobar', deps=1)
print(result.output)
#> {"foobar":1,"spam":1.0}

```

This is useful if you want to customise a tool at call time, or omit it completely from a step. See ToolPrepareFunc. | `None` | | `docstring_format` | `DocstringFormat` | The format of the docstring, see DocstringFormat. Defaults to 'auto', such that the format is inferred from the structure of the docstring. | `'auto'` | | `require_parameter_descriptions` | `bool` | If True, raise an error if a parameter description is missing. Defaults to False. | `False` | | `schema_generator` | `type[GenerateJsonSchema]` | The JSON schema generator class to use for this tool. Defaults to GenerateToolJsonSchema. | `GenerateToolJsonSchema` | | `strict` | `bool | None` | Whether to enforce JSON schema compliance (only affects OpenAI).

# `pydantic_ai.models.anthropic`

## Setup

For details on how to set up authentication with this model, see [model configuration for Anthropic](../../../models/anthropic/).

### LatestAnthropicModelNames

```python
LatestAnthropicModelNames = ModelParam

```

Latest Anthropic models.

### AnthropicModelName

```python
AnthropicModelName = Union[str, LatestAnthropicModelNames]

```

Possible Anthropic model names.

Since Anthropic supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [the Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) for a full list.

### AnthropicModelSettings

Bases: `ModelSettings`

Settings used for an Anthropic model request.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/anthropic.py`

```python
class AnthropicModelSettings(ModelSettings, total=False):
    """Settings used for an Anthropic model request."""

    """

```

#### anthropic_metadata

```python
anthropic_metadata: BetaMetadataParam

```

An object describing metadata about the request.

Contains `user_id`, an external identifier for the user who is associated with the request.

#### anthropic_thinking

```python
anthropic_thinking: BetaThinkingConfigParam

```

Determine whether the model should generate a thinking block.

See [the Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for more information.

### AnthropicModel

Bases: `Model`

A model that uses the Anthropic API.

Internally, this uses the [Anthropic Python client](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) to interact with the API.

```

Whether to allow requests to models.

This global setting allows you to disable request to most models, e.g. to make sure you don't accidentally make costly requests to a model during tests.

The testing models TestModel and FunctionModel are no affected by this setting.

### check_allow_model_requests

```python
check_allow_model_requests() -> None

```

Check if model requests are allowed.

If you're defining your own models that have costs or latency associated with their use, you should call this in Model.request and Model.request_stream.

Raises:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `RuntimeError` | If model requests are not allowed. |

## Setup

For details on how to set up authentication with this model, see [model configuration for Cohere](../../../models/cohere/).

### LatestCohereModelNames

```python
LatestCohereModelNames = Literal[
    "c4ai-aya-expanse-32b",
    "c4ai-aya-expanse-8b",
    "command",
    "command-light",

    "command-r-plus-08-2024",
    "command-r7b-12-2024",
]

```

Latest Cohere models.

### CohereModelName

```python
CohereModelName = Union[str, LatestCohereModelNames]

```

Possible Cohere model names.

Since Cohere supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [Cohere's docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models) for a list of all available models.

### CohereModelSettings

Bases: `ModelSettings`

Settings used for a Cohere model request.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/cohere.py`

```python
class CohereModelSettings(ModelSettings, total=False):
    """Settings used for a Cohere model request."""

```

### CohereModel

Bases: `Model`

A model that uses the Cohere API.

Internally, this uses the [Cohere Python client](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python) to interact with the API.

Apart from `__init__`, all methods are private or match those of the base class.

# `pydantic_ai.models.function`

A model controlled by a local function.

FunctionModel is similar to [`TestModel`](../test/), but allows greater control over the model's behavior.

Its primary use case is for more advanced unit testing than is possible with `TestModel`.

Here's a minimal example:

function_model_usage.py

```py

from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelMessage, ModelResponse, TextPart
from pydantic_ai.models.function import FunctionModel, AgentInfo

my_agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')

            parts=[

                    timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
                )
            ]
        )
    ]
    """
    print(info)
    """
    AgentInfo(
        function_tools=[], allow_text_output=True, output_tools=[], model_settings=None
    )
    """
    return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart('hello world')])


async def test_my_agent():
    """Unit test for my_agent, to be run by pytest."""
    with my_agent.override(model=FunctionModel(model_function)):
        result = await my_agent.run('Testing my agent...')
        assert result.output == 'hello world'

```

### DeltaThinkingPart

Incremental change to a thinking part.

Used to describe a chunk when streaming thinking responses.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/function.py`

```python
@dataclass
class DeltaThinkingPart:
    """Incremental change to a thinking part.

Incremental change to the thinking signature.

### DeltaToolCalls

```python
DeltaToolCalls: TypeAlias = dict[int, DeltaToolCall]

```

A mapping of tool call IDs to incremental changes.

### DeltaThinkingCalls

```python
DeltaThinkingCalls: TypeAlias = dict[int, DeltaThinkingPart]

```

A mapping of thinking call IDs to incremental changes.

### FunctionDef

```python
FunctionDef: TypeAlias = Callable[
    [list[ModelMessage], AgentInfo],
    Union[ModelResponse, Awaitable[ModelResponse]],
]

```

A function used to generate a non-streamed response.

### StreamFunctionDef

```python
StreamFunctionDef: TypeAlias = Callable[
    [list[ModelMessage], AgentInfo],
    AsyncIterator[
        Union[str, DeltaToolCalls, DeltaThinkingCalls]
    ],
]

```

A function used to generate a streamed response.

While this is defined as having return type of `AsyncIterator[Union[str, DeltaToolCalls, DeltaThinkingCalls]]`, it should really be considered as `Union[AsyncIterator[str], AsyncIterator[DeltaToolCalls], AsyncIterator[DeltaThinkingCalls]]`,

E.g. you need to yield all text, all `DeltaToolCalls`, or all `DeltaThinkingCalls`, not mix them.

# `pydantic_ai.models.gemini`

Custom interface to the `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` API using [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

The Google SDK for interacting with the `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` API [`google-generativeai`](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?lang=python) reads like it was written by a Java developer who thought they knew everything about OOP, spent 30 minutes trying to learn Python, gave up and decided to build the library to prove how horrible Python is. It also doesn't use httpx for HTTP requests, and tries to implement tool calling itself, but doesn't use Pydantic or equivalent for validation.

We therefore implement support for the API directly.

Despite these shortcomings, the Gemini model is actually quite powerful and very fast.

## Setup

For details on how to set up authentication with this model, see [model configuration for Gemini](../../../models/gemini/).

### LatestGeminiModelNames

```python
LatestGeminiModelNames = Literal[
    "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "gemini-2.0-flash-lite",
    "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17",
    "gemini-2.5-pro",
]

```

Latest Gemini models.

### GeminiModelName

```python
GeminiModelName = Union[str, LatestGeminiModelNames]

```

Possible Gemini model names.

Since Gemini supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [the Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#model-variations) for a full list.

### GeminiModelSettings

Bases: `ModelSettings`

Settings used for a Gemini model request.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/gemini.py`

```python
class GeminiModelSettings(ModelSettings, total=False):
    """Settings used for a Gemini model request."""

    gemini_thinking_config: ThinkingConfig
    """Thinking is "on" by default in both the API and AI Studio.

    Being on by default doesn't mean the model will send back thoughts. For that, you would need to set `include_thoughts`
    to `True`, but since end of January 2025, `thoughts` are not returned anymore, and are only displayed in the Google
    AI Studio. See https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/thoughts-are-missing-cot-not-included-anymore/63653 for more details.

    If you want to avoid the model spending any tokens on thinking, you can set `thinking_budget` to `0`.

    """

```

#### gemini_safety_settings

```python

See more about it on <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking>.

#### gemini_labels

```python
gemini_labels: dict[str, str]

```

User-defined metadata to break down billed charges. Only supported by the Vertex AI provider.

See the [Gemini API docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/add-labels-to-api-calls) for use cases and limitations.

### GeminiModel

Bases: `Model`

A model that uses Gemini via `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` API.

This is implemented from scratch rather than using a dedicated SDK, good API documentation is available [here](https://ai.google.dev/api).

Apart from `__init__`, all methods are private or match those of the base class.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/gemini.py`

Since the model name isn't known until the request is made, this property always returns `'mcp-sampling'`.

#### system

```python
system: str

```

The system / model provider, returns `'MCP'`.

# `pydantic_ai.models.mistral`

## Setup

For details on how to set up authentication with this model, see [model configuration for Mistral](../../../models/mistral/).

### LatestMistralModelNames

```python
LatestMistralModelNames = Literal[
    "mistral-large-latest",
    "mistral-small-latest",
    "codestral-latest",
    "mistral-moderation-latest",
]

```

Latest Mistral models.

### MistralModelName

```python
MistralModelName = Union[str, LatestMistralModelNames]

```

Possible Mistral model names.

Since Mistral supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the most popular models but allow any name in the type hints. Since [the Mistral docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/) for a full list.

### MistralModelSettings

Bases: `ModelSettings`

Settings used for a Mistral model request.

Source code in `pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/mistral.py`

```python
class MistralModelSettings(ModelSettings, total=False):
    """Settings used for a Mistral model request."""

```

### MistralModel

Bases: `Model`

A model that uses Mistral.

Internally, this uses the [Mistral Python client](https://github.com/mistralai/client-python) to interact with the API.

# `pydantic_ai.models.openai`

## Setup

For details on how to set up authentication with this model, see [model configuration for OpenAI](../../../models/openai/).

### OpenAIModelName

```python
OpenAIModelName = Union[str, AllModels]

```

Possible OpenAI model names.

Since OpenAI supports a variety of date-stamped models, we explicitly list the latest models but allow any name in the type hints. See [the OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for a full list.

Using this more broad type for the model name instead of the ChatModel definition allows this model to be used more easily with other model types (ie, Ollama, Deepseek).

Initialize an OpenAI model.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `model_name` | `OpenAIModelName` | The name of the OpenAI model to use. List of model names available here (Unfortunately, despite being ask to do so, OpenAI do not provide .inv files for their API). | *required* | | `provider` | `Literal['openai', 'deepseek', 'azure', 'openrouter', 'grok', 'fireworks', 'together', 'heroku', 'github'] | Provider[AsyncOpenAI]` | The provider to use. Defaults to 'openai'. | `'openai'` | | `profile` | `ModelProfileSpec | None` | The model profile to use. Defaults to a profile picked by the provider based on the model name. | `None` | | `system_prompt_role` | `OpenAISystemPromptRole | None` | The role to use for the system prompt message. If not provided, defaults to 'system'. In the future, this may be inferred from the model name. | `None` | | `settings` | `ModelSettings | None` | Default model settings for this model instance. | `None` |

### OpenAIResponsesModel

Bases: `Model`

A model that uses the OpenAI Responses API.

The [OpenAI Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) is the new API for OpenAI models.

The Responses API has built-in tools, that you can use instead of building your own:

- [Web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search)
- [File search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search)
- [Computer use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)

Use the `openai_builtin_tools` setting to add these tools to your model.

If you are interested in the differences between the Responses API and the Chat Completions API, see the [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions).

    assert m.last_model_request_parameters.function_tools == []

```

### TestModel

Bases: `Model`

A model specifically for testing purposes.

This will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return a tool response if possible, otherwise a plain response.

How useful this model is will vary significantly.

Apart from `__init__` derived by the `dataclass` decorator, all methods are private or match those of the base class.

# `pydantic_evals.dataset`

Dataset management for pydantic evals.

This module provides functionality for creating, loading, saving, and evaluating datasets of test cases. Each case must have inputs, and can optionally have a name, expected output, metadata, and case-specific evaluators.

Datasets can be loaded from and saved to YAML or JSON files, and can be evaluated against a task function to produce an evaluation report.

### Case

Bases: `Generic[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]`

A single row of a Dataset.

Each case represents a single test scenario with inputs to test. A case may optionally specify a name, expected outputs to compare against, and arbitrary metadata.

Cases can also have their own specific evaluators which are run in addition to dataset-level evaluators.

Example:

```python
from pydantic_evals import Case

case = Case(
    name='Simple addition',
    inputs={'a': 1, 'b': 2},
    expected_output=3,
    metadata={'description': 'Tests basic addition'},
)

### EvaluatorContext

Bases: `Generic[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]`

Context for evaluating a task execution.

An instance of this class is the sole input to all Evaluators. It contains all the information needed to evaluate the task execution, including inputs, outputs, metadata, and telemetry data.

Evaluators use this context to access the task inputs, actual output, expected output, and other information when evaluating the result of the task execution.

Example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_evals.evaluators import Evaluator, EvaluatorContext


@dataclass
class ExactMatch(Evaluator):
    def evaluate(self, ctx: EvaluatorContext) -> bool:
        # Use the context to access task inputs, outputs, and expected outputs
        return ctx.output == ctx.expected_output

# `pydantic_evals.generation`

Utilities for generating example datasets for pydantic_evals.

This module provides functions for generating sample datasets for testing and examples, using LLMs to create realistic test data with proper structure.

### generate_dataset

```python
generate_dataset(
    *,
    dataset_type: type[
        Dataset[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]
    ],
    path: Path | str | None = None,

    model: Model | KnownModelName = "openai:gpt-4o",
    n_examples: int = 3,
    extra_instructions: str | None = None
) -> Dataset[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]

```

Use an LLM to generate a dataset of test cases, each consisting of input, expected output, and metadata.

This function creates a properly structured dataset with the specified input, output, and metadata types. It uses an LLM to attempt to generate realistic test cases that conform to the types' schemas.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `path` | `Path | str | None` | Optional path to save the generated dataset. If provided, the dataset will be saved to this location. | `None` | | `dataset_type` | `type[Dataset[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]]` | The type of dataset to generate, with the desired input, output, and metadata types. | *required* | | `custom_evaluator_types` | `Sequence[type[Evaluator[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]]]` | Optional sequence of custom evaluator classes to include in the schema. | `()` | | `model` | `Model | KnownModelName` | The Pydantic AI model to use for generation. Defaults to 'gpt-4o'. | `'openai:gpt-4o'` | | `n_examples` | `int` | Number of examples to generate. Defaults to 3. | `3` | | `extra_instructions` | `str | None` | Optional additional instructions to provide to the LLM. | `None` |

Returns:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `Dataset[InputsT, OutputT, MetadataT]` | A properly structured Dataset object with generated test cases. |

Raises:

| Type | Description | | --- | --- | | `ValidationError` | If the LLM's response cannot be parsed as a valid dataset. |

### Graph

Bases: `Generic[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]`

Definition of a graph.

In `pydantic-graph`, a graph is a collection of nodes that can be run in sequence. The nodes define their outgoing edges â€” e.g. which nodes may be run next, and thereby the structure of the graph.

Here's a very simple example of a graph which increments a number by 1, but makes sure the number is never 42 at the end.

never_42.py

```py
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import BaseNode, End, Graph, GraphRunContext

@dataclass
class MyState:
    number: int

@dataclass
class Increment(BaseNode[MyState]):
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext) -> Check42:
        ctx.state.number += 1
        return Check42()

@dataclass
class Check42(BaseNode[MyState, None, int]):
    async def run(self, ctx: GraphRunContext) -> Increment | End[int]:
        if ctx.state.number == 42:
            return Increment()
        else:
            return End(ctx.state.number)

never_42_graph = Graph(nodes=(Increment, Check42))

```

    infer_name: bool = True
) -> AsyncIterator[GraphRun[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]]

```

A contextmanager which can be used to iterate over the graph's nodes as they are executed.

This method returns a `GraphRun` object which can be used to async-iterate over the nodes of this `Graph` as they are executed. This is the API to use if you want to record or interact with the nodes as the graph execution unfolds.

The `GraphRun` can also be used to manually drive the graph execution by calling GraphRun.next.

The `GraphRun` provides access to the full run history, state, deps, and the final result of the run once it has completed.

For more details, see the API documentation of GraphRun.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `start_node` | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]` | the first node to run. Since the graph definition doesn't define the entry point in the graph, you need to provide the starting node. | *required* | | `state` | `StateT` | The initial state of the graph. | `None` | | `deps` | `DepsT` | The dependencies of the graph. | `None` | | `persistence` | `BaseStatePersistence[StateT, RunEndT] | None` | State persistence interface, defaults to SimpleStatePersistence if None. | `None` | | `span` | `AbstractContextManager[AbstractSpan] | None` | The span to use for the graph run. If not provided, a new span will be created. | `None` | | `infer_name` | `bool` | Whether to infer the graph name from the calling frame. | `True` |

Returns: A GraphRun that can be async iterated over to drive the graph to completion.

A contextmanager to iterate over the graph's nodes as they are executed, created from a persistence object.

This method has similar functionality to iter, but instead of passing the node to run, it will restore the node and state from state persistence.

### GraphRun

Bases: `Generic[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]`

A stateful, async-iterable run of a Graph.

You typically get a `GraphRun` instance from calling `async with [my_graph.iter(...)][pydantic_graph.graph.Graph.iter] as graph_run:`. That gives you the ability to iterate through nodes as they run, either by `async for` iteration or by repeatedly calling `.next(...)`.

Here's an example of iterating over the graph from above: iter_never_42.py

```py
from copy import deepcopy
from never_42 import Increment, MyState, never_42_graph

async def main():
    state = MyState(1)
    async with never_42_graph.iter(Increment(), state=state) as graph_run:
        node_states = [(graph_run.next_node, deepcopy(graph_run.state))]
        async for node in graph_run:
            node_states.append((node, deepcopy(graph_run.state)))
        print(node_states)
        '''
        [
            (Increment(), MyState(number=1)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=1)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=2)),
            (End(data=2), MyState(number=2)),
        ]
        '''

    state = MyState(41)
    async with never_42_graph.iter(Increment(), state=state) as graph_run:
        node_states = [(graph_run.next_node, deepcopy(graph_run.state))]
        async for node in graph_run:
            node_states.append((node, deepcopy(graph_run.state)))
        print(node_states)
        '''
        [
            (Increment(), MyState(number=41)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=41)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=42)),
            (Increment(), MyState(number=42)),
            (Check42(), MyState(number=43)),
            (End(data=43), MyState(number=43)),

```

Create a new run for a given graph, starting at the specified node.

Typically, you'll use Graph.iter rather than calling this directly.

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `graph` | `Graph[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]` | The Graph to run. | *required* | | `start_node` | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT]` | The node where execution will begin. | *required* | | `persistence` | `BaseStatePersistence[StateT, RunEndT]` | State persistence interface. | *required* | | `state` | `StateT` | A shared state object or primitive (like a counter, dataclass, etc.) that is available to all nodes via ctx.state. | *required* | | `deps` | `DepsT` | Optional dependencies that each node can access via ctx.deps, e.g. database connections, configuration, or logging clients. | *required* | | `traceparent` | `str | None` | The traceparent for the span used for the graph run. | *required* | | `snapshot_id` | `str | None` | The ID of the snapshot the node came from. | `None` |

```

#### next_node

```python
next_node: BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | End[RunEndT]

```

The next node that will be run in the graph.

This is the next node that will be used during async iteration, or if a node is not passed to `self.next(...)`.

#### result

```python
result: GraphRunResult[StateT, RunEndT] | None

```

The final result of the graph run if the run is completed, otherwise `None`.

#### next

```python
next(
    node: BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | None = None,
) -> BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | End[RunEndT]

```

Manually drive the graph run by passing in the node you want to run next.

This lets you inspect or mutate the node before continuing execution, or skip certain nodes under dynamic conditions. The graph run should stop when you return an End node.

Here's an example of using `next` to drive the graph from above: next_never_42.py

```py
from copy import deepcopy
from pydantic_graph import End
from never_42 import Increment, MyState, never_42_graph

async def main():
    state = MyState(48)
    async with never_42_graph.iter(Increment(), state=state) as graph_run:
        next_node = graph_run.next_node  # start with the first node
        node_states = [(next_node, deepcopy(graph_run.state))]

        while not isinstance(next_node, End):
            if graph_run.state.number == 50:
                graph_run.state.number = 42
            next_node = await graph_run.next(next_node)

            (End(data=49), MyState(number=49)),
        ]
        '''

```

Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Default | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `node` | `BaseNode[StateT, DepsT, RunEndT] | None` | The node to run next in the graph. If not specified, uses self.next_node, which is initialized to the start_node of the run and updated each time a new node is returned. | `None` |

#### json_file

```python

You should use a different file for each graph run, but a single file should be reused for multiple steps of the same run.

```py
from pathlib import Path

from pydantic_graph import FullStatePersistence

run_id = 'run_123abc'
persistence = FullStatePersistence(Path('runs') / f'{run_id}.json')

```

#### should_set_types

```python
should_set_types() -> bool

```

Whether types need to be set.

Source code in `pydantic_graph/pydantic_graph/persistence/file.py`

```python

# Evals

# Evals

"Evals" refers to evaluating a model's performance for a specific application.

Warning

Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.

Pydantic Evals is a powerful evaluation framework designed to help you systematically test and evaluate the performance and accuracy of the systems you build, especially when working with LLMs.

We've designed Pydantic Evals to be useful while not being too opinionated since we (along with everyone else) are still figuring out best practices. We'd love your [feedback](../help/) on the package and how we can improve it.

In Beta

Pydantic Evals support was [introduced](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/935) in v0.0.47 and is currently in beta. The API is subject to change and the documentation is incomplete.

## Installation

To install the Pydantic Evals package, run:

```bash
pip install pydantic-evals

```

```bash
uv add pydantic-evals

```

`pydantic-evals` does not depend on `pydantic-ai`, but has an optional dependency on `logfire` if you'd like to use OpenTelemetry traces in your evals, or send evaluation results to [logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

```bash
pip install 'pydantic-evals[logfire]'

```

```bash
uv add 'pydantic-evals[logfire]'

```

## Datasets and Cases

In Pydantic Evals, everything begins with `Dataset`s and `Case`s:

- Case: A single test scenario corresponding to "task" inputs. Can also optionally have a name, expected outputs, metadata, and evaluators.
- Dataset: A collection of test cases designed for the evaluation of a specific task or function.

simple_eval_dataset.py

```python
from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset

case1 = Case(
    name='simple_case',
    inputs='What is the capital of France?',
    expected_output='Paris',
    metadata={'difficulty': 'easy'},
)

dataset = Dataset(cases=[case1])

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Evaluators

Evaluators are the components that analyze and score the results of your task when tested against a case.

Pydantic Evals includes several built-in evaluators and allows you to create custom evaluators:

simple_eval_evaluator.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from simple_eval_dataset import dataset

from pydantic_evals.evaluators import Evaluator, EvaluatorContext
from pydantic_evals.evaluators.common import IsInstance

dataset.add_evaluator(IsInstance(type_name='str'))  # (1)!


@dataclass
class MyEvaluator(Evaluator):
    async def evaluate(self, ctx: EvaluatorContext[str, str]) -> float:  # (2)!
        if ctx.output == ctx.expected_output:
            return 1.0
        elif (
            isinstance(ctx.output, str)
            and ctx.expected_output.lower() in ctx.output.lower()
        ):
            return 0.8
        else:
            return 0.0


dataset.add_evaluator(MyEvaluator())

```

1. You can add built-in evaluators to a dataset using the add_evaluator method.
1. This custom evaluator returns a simple score based on whether the output matches the expected output.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

## Evaluation Process

The evaluation process involves running a task against all cases in a dataset:

Putting the above two examples together and using the more declarative `evaluators` kwarg to Dataset:

simple_eval_complete.py

```python
from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset
from pydantic_evals.evaluators import Evaluator, EvaluatorContext, IsInstance

case1 = Case(  # (1)!
    name='simple_case',
    inputs='What is the capital of France?',
    expected_output='Paris',
    metadata={'difficulty': 'easy'},
)


class MyEvaluator(Evaluator[str, str]):
    def evaluate(self, ctx: EvaluatorContext[str, str]) -> float:
        if ctx.output == ctx.expected_output:
            return 1.0
        elif (
            isinstance(ctx.output, str)
            and ctx.expected_output.lower() in ctx.output.lower()
        ):
            return 0.8
        else:
            return 0.0


dataset = Dataset(
    cases=[case1],
    evaluators=[IsInstance(type_name='str'), MyEvaluator()],  # (3)!
)


async def guess_city(question: str) -> str:  # (4)!
    return 'Paris'

1. Create a test case as above
1. Also create a custom evaluator function as above
1. Create a Dataset with test cases, also set the evaluators when creating the dataset
1. Our function to evaluate.
1. Run the evaluation with evaluate_sync, which runs the function against all test cases in the dataset, and returns an EvaluationReport object.
1. Print the report with print, which shows the results of the evaluation, including input and output. We have omitted duration here just to keep the printed output from changing from run to run.

1. Define models for our task â€” Input for recipe generation task and output of the task.
1. Define our recipe generation function - this is the task we want to evaluate.
1. Create a dataset with different test cases and different rubrics.
1. No expected output, we'll let the LLM judge the quality.
1. Case-specific evaluator with a focused rubric using LLMJudge.
1. Dataset-level evaluators that apply to all cases, including a general quality rubric for all recipes
1. By default `LLMJudge` uses `openai:gpt-4o`, here we use a specific Anthropic model.

## OpenTelemetry Integration

Pydantic Evals integrates with OpenTelemetry for tracing.

The EvaluatorContext includes a property called `span_tree` which returns a SpanTree. The `SpanTree` provides a way to query and analyze the spans generated during function execution. This provides a way to access the results of instrumentation during evaluation.

Note

If you just want to write unit tests that ensure that specific spans are produced during calls to your evaluation task, it's usually better to just use the `logfire.testing.capfire` fixture directly.

There are two main ways this is useful.

opentelemetry_example.py

## Generating Test Datasets

Pydantic Evals allows you to generate test datasets using LLMs with generate_dataset.

Datasets can be generated in either JSON or YAML format, in both cases a JSON schema file is generated alongside the dataset and referenced in the dataset, so you should get type checking and auto-completion in your editor.

generate_dataset_example.py

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from pydantic_evals import Dataset
from pydantic_evals.generation import generate_dataset


class QuestionInputs(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (1)!
    """Model for question inputs."""

    question: str
    """A question to answer"""
    context: str | None = None
    """Optional context for the question"""


class AnswerOutput(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (2)!
    """Model for expected answer outputs."""

    answer: str
    """The answer to the question"""
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1)
    """Confidence level (0-1)"""


class MetadataType(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (3)!
    """Metadata model for test cases."""

    difficulty: str

```

1. Define the schema for the inputs to the task.
1. Define the schema for the expected outputs of the task.
1. Define the schema for the metadata of the test cases.
1. Call generate_dataset to create a Dataset with 2 cases confirming to the schema.
1. Save the dataset to a YAML file, this will also write `questions_cases_schema.json` with the schema JSON schema for `questions_cases.yaml` to make editing easier. The magic `yaml-language-server` comment is supported by at least vscode, jetbrains/pycharm (more details [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#using-inlined-schema)).

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main(answer))` to run `main`)*

You can also write datasets as JSON files:

```

1. Generate the Dataset exactly as above.
1. Save the dataset to a JSON file, this will also write `questions_cases_schema.json` with th JSON schema for `questions_cases.json`. This time the `$schema` key is included in the JSON file to define the schema for IDEs to use while you edit the file, there's no formal spec for this, but it works in vscode and pycharm and is discussed at length in [json-schema-org/json-schema-spec#828](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/828).

## Integration with Logfire

Pydantic Evals is implemented using OpenTelemetry to record traces of the evaluation process. These traces contain all the information included in the terminal output as attributes, but also include full tracing from the executions of the evaluation task function.

You can send these traces to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, including [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs).

All you need to do is configure Logfire via `logfire.configure`:

logfire_integration.py

```python
import logfire
from judge_recipes import recipe_dataset, transform_recipe

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire='if-token-present',  # (1)!
    environment='development',  # (2)!
    service_name='evals',  # (3)!
)

recipe_dataset.evaluate_sync(transform_recipe)

```

1. The `send_to_logfire` argument controls when traces are sent to Logfire. You can set it to `'if-token-present'` to send data to Logfire only if the `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` environment variable is set. See the [Logfire configuration docs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/configuration/) for more details.
1. The `environment` argument sets the environment for the traces. It's a good idea to set this to `'development'` when running tests or evaluations and sending data to a project with production data, to make it easier to filter these traces out while reviewing data from your production environment(s).
1. The `service_name` argument sets the service name for the traces. This is displayed in the Logfire UI to help you identify the source of the associated spans.

Logfire has some special integration with Pydantic Evals traces, including a table view of the evaluation results on the evaluation root span (which is generated in each call to Dataset.evaluate):

and a detailed view of the inputs and outputs for the execution of each case:

In addition, any OpenTelemetry spans generated during the evaluation process will be sent to Logfire, allowing you to visualize the full execution of the code called during the evaluation process:

This can be especially helpful when attempting to write evaluators that make use of the `span_tree` property of the EvaluatorContext, as described in the [OpenTelemetry Integration](#opentelemetry-integration) section above.

This allows you to write evaluations that depend on information about which code paths were executed during the call to the task function without needing to manually instrument the code being evaluated, as long as the code being evaluated is already adequately instrumented with OpenTelemetry. In the case of Pydantic AI agents, for example, this can be used to ensure specific tools are (or are not) called during the execution of specific cases.

Using OpenTelemetry in this way also means that all data used to evaluate the task executions will be accessible in the traces produced by production runs of the code, making it straightforward to perform the same evaluations on production data.
# MCP

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Pydantic AI supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) in three ways:

1. [Agents](../agents/) act as an MCP Client, connecting to MCP servers to use their tools, [learn more â€¦](client/)
1. Agents can be used within MCP servers, [learn more â€¦](server/)
1. As part of Pydantic AI, we're building a number of MCP servers, [see below](#mcp-servers)

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized protocol that allow AI applications (including programmatic agents like Pydantic AI, coding agents like [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and desktop applications like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) to connect to external tools and services using a common interface.

As with other protocols, the dream of MCP is that a wide range of applications can speak to each other without the need for specific integrations.

There is a great list of MCP servers at [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

Some examples of what this means:

- Pydantic AI could use a web search service implemented as an MCP server to implement a deep research agent
- Cursor could connect to the [Pydantic Logfire](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire-mcp) MCP server to search logs, traces and metrics to gain context while fixing a bug
- Pydantic AI, or any other MCP client could connect to our [Run Python](run-python/) MCP server to run arbitrary Python code in a sandboxed environment

## MCP Servers

To add functionality to Pydantic AI while making it as widely usable as possible, we're implementing some functionality as MCP servers.

So far, we've only implemented one MCP server as part of Pydantic AI:

- [Run Python](run-python/): A sandboxed Python interpreter that can run arbitrary code, with a focus on security and safety.

# Client

Pydantic AI can act as an [MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client), connecting to MCP servers to use their tools.

## Install

You need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../../install/), or[`pydantic-ai-slim`](../../install/#slim-install) with the `mcp` optional group:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]"

```

Note

MCP integration requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Usage

Pydantic AI comes with two ways to connect to MCP servers:

- MCPServerStreamableHTTP which connects to an MCP server using the [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#streamable-http) transport
- MCPServerSSE which connects to an MCP server using the [HTTP SSE](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse) transport
- MCPServerStdio which runs the server as a subprocess and connects to it using the [stdio](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) transport

Examples of all three are shown below; [mcp-run-python](../run-python/) is used as the MCP server in all examples.

Each MCP server instance is a [toolset](../../toolsets/) and can be registered with an Agent using the `toolsets` argument.

You can use the async with agent context manager to open and close connections to all registered servers (and in the case of stdio servers, start and stop the subprocesses) around the context where they'll be used in agent runs. You can also use async with server to manage the connection or subprocess of a specific server, for example if you'd like to use it with multiple agents. If you don't explicitly enter one of these context managers to set up the server, this will be done automatically when it's needed (e.g. to list the available tools or call a specific tool), but it's more efficient to do so around the entire context where you expect the servers to be used.

### Streamable HTTP Client

MCPServerStreamableHTTP connects over HTTP using the [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#streamable-http) transport to a server.

Note

MCPServerStreamableHTTP requires an MCP server to be running and accepting HTTP connections before running the agent. Running the server is not managed by Pydantic AI.

Before creating the Streamable HTTP client, we need to run a server that supports the Streamable HTTP transport.

streamable_http_server.py

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

app = FastMCP()

@app.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(transport='streamable-http')

```

Then we can create the client:

mcp_streamable_http_client.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHTTP

server = MCPServerStreamableHTTP('http://localhost:8000/mcp')  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])  # (2)!

async def main():
    async with agent:  # (3)!
        result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')
    print(result.output)
    #> There are 9,208 days between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2025.

```

1. Define the MCP server with the URL used to connect.
1. Create an agent with the MCP server attached.
1. Create a client session to connect to the server.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

**What's happening here?**

- The model is receiving the prompt "how many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?"
- The model decides "Oh, I've got this `run_python_code` tool, that will be a good way to answer this question", and writes some python code to calculate the answer.
- The model returns a tool call
- Pydantic AI sends the tool call to the MCP server using the SSE transport
- The model is called again with the return value of running the code
- The model returns the final answer

You can visualise this clearly, and even see the code that's run by adding three lines of code to instrument the example with [logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs):

mcp_sse_client_logfire.py

```python
import logfire

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()

```

Will display as follows:

### SSE Client

MCPServerSSE connects over HTTP using the [HTTP + Server Sent Events transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse) to a server.

Note

MCPServerSSE requires an MCP server to be running and accepting HTTP connections before running the agent. Running the server is not managed by Pydantic AI.

The name "HTTP" is used since this implementation will be adapted in future to use the new [Streamable HTTP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/206) currently in development.

Before creating the SSE client, we need to run the server (docs [here](../run-python/)):

terminal (run sse server)

```bash
deno run \
  -N -R=node_modules -W=node_modules --node-modules-dir=auto \
  jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python sse

```

mcp_sse_client.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerSSE

server = MCPServerSSE(url='http://localhost:3001/sse')  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])  # (2)!


async def main():
    async with agent:  # (3)!
        result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')
    print(result.output)
    #> There are 9,208 days between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2025.

```

1. Define the MCP server with the URL used to connect.
1. Create an agent with the MCP server attached.
1. Create a client session to connect to the server.

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

### MCP "stdio" Server

The other transport offered by MCP is the [stdio transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) where the server is run as a subprocess and communicates with the client over `stdin` and `stdout`. In this case, you'd use the MCPServerStdio class.

mcp_stdio_client.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio(  # (1)!
    'deno',
    args=[
        'run',
        '-N',
        '-R=node_modules',
        '-W=node_modules',
        '--node-modules-dir=auto',
        'jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python',
        'stdio',
    ]
)
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])


async def main():
    async with agent:
        result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')
    print(result.output)
    #> There are 9,208 days between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2025.

```

1. See [MCP Run Python](../run-python/) for more information.

## Tool call customisation

The MCP servers provide the ability to set a `process_tool_call` which allows the customisation of tool call requests and their responses.

A common use case for this is to inject metadata to the requests which the server call needs.

mcp_process_tool_call.py

```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import CallToolFunc, MCPServerStdio, ToolResult
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.tools import RunContext


async def process_tool_call(
    ctx: RunContext[int],
    call_tool: CallToolFunc,
    name: str,
    tool_args: dict[str, Any],
) -> ToolResult:
    """A tool call processor that passes along the deps."""
    return await call_tool(name, tool_args, {'deps': ctx.deps})


server = MCPServerStdio('python', ['mcp_server.py'], process_tool_call=process_tool_call)
agent = Agent(
    model=TestModel(call_tools=['echo_deps']),
    deps_type=int,
    toolsets=[server]
)


async def main():
    async with agent:
        result = await agent.run('Echo with deps set to 42', deps=42)
    print(result.output)
    #> {"echo_deps":{"echo":"This is an echo message","deps":42}}

```

## Using Tool Prefixes to Avoid Naming Conflicts

When connecting to multiple MCP servers that might provide tools with the same name, you can use the `tool_prefix` parameter to avoid naming conflicts. This parameter adds a prefix to all tool names from a specific server.

This allows you to use multiple servers that might have overlapping tool names without conflicts:

mcp_tool_prefix_http_client.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerSSE

# Create two servers with different prefixes
weather_server = MCPServerSSE(
    url='http://localhost:3001/sse',
    tool_prefix='weather'  # Tools will be prefixed with 'weather_'
)

calculator_server = MCPServerSSE(
    url='http://localhost:3002/sse',
    tool_prefix='calc'  # Tools will be prefixed with 'calc_'
)

# Both servers might have a tool named 'get_data', but they'll be exposed as:
# - 'weather_get_data'
# - 'calc_get_data'
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[weather_server, calculator_server])

```

## MCP Sampling

In MCP [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling) is a system by which an MCP server can make LLM calls via the MCP client - effectively proxying requests to an LLM via the client over whatever transport is being used.

Sampling is extremely useful when MCP servers need to use Gen AI but you don't want to provision them each with their own LLM credentials or when a public MCP server would like the connecting client to pay for LLM calls.

Confusingly it has nothing to do with the concept of "sampling" in observability, or frankly the concept of "sampling" in any other domain.

Sampling Diagram

Here's a mermaid diagram that may or may not make the data flow clearer:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant LLM
    participant MCP_Client as MCP client
    participant MCP_Server as MCP server

    MCP_Client->>LLM: LLM call
    LLM->>MCP_Client: LLM tool call response

    MCP_Client->>MCP_Server: tool call
    MCP_Server->>MCP_Client: sampling "create message"

    MCP_Client->>LLM: LLM call
    LLM->>MCP_Client: LLM text response

    MCP_Client->>MCP_Server: sampling response
    MCP_Server->>MCP_Client: tool call response
```

Pydantic AI supports sampling as both a client and server. See the [server](../server/#mcp-sampling) documentation for details on how to use sampling within a server.

Sampling is automatically supported by Pydantic AI agents when they act as a client.

To be able to use sampling, an MCP server instance needs to have a sampling_model set. This can be done either directly on the server using the constructor keyword argument or the property, or by using agent.set_mcp_sampling_model() to set the agent's model or one specified as an argument as the sampling model on all MCP servers registered with that agent.

Let's say we have an MCP server that wants to use sampling (in this case to generate an SVG as per the tool arguments).

Sampling MCP Server generate_svg.py

````python
import re
from pathlib import Path

from mcp import SamplingMessage
from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context, FastMCP
from mcp.types import TextContent

app = FastMCP()


@app.tool()
async def image_generator(ctx: Context, subject: str, style: str) -> str:
    prompt = f'{subject=} {style=}'
    # `ctx.session.create_message` is the sampling call
    result = await ctx.session.create_message(
        [SamplingMessage(role='user', content=TextContent(type='text', text=prompt))],
        max_tokens=1_024,
        system_prompt='Generate an SVG image as per the user input',
    )
    assert isinstance(result.content, TextContent)

    path = Path(f'{subject}_{style}.svg')
    # remove triple backticks if the svg was returned within markdown
    if m := re.search(r'^```\w*$(.+?)```$', result.content.text, re.S | re.M):
        path.write_text(m.group(1))
    else:
        path.write_text(result.content.text)
    return f'See {path}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run the server via stdio
    app.run()

````

Using this server with an `Agent` will automatically allow sampling:

sampling_mcp_client.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio(command='python', args=['generate_svg.py'])
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', toolsets=[server])


async def main():
    async with agent:
        agent.set_mcp_sampling_model()
        result = await agent.run('Create an image of a robot in a punk style.')
    print(result.output)
    #> Image file written to robot_punk.svg.

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+)*

You can disallow sampling by setting allow_sampling=False when creating the server reference, e.g.:

sampling_disallowed.py

```python
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio(
    command='python',
    args=['generate_svg.py'],
    allow_sampling=False,
)

```

# MCP Run Python

The **MCP Run Python** package is an MCP server that allows agents to execute Python code in a secure, sandboxed environment. It uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to run Python code in a JavaScript environment with [Deno](https://deno.com/), isolating execution from the host system.

## Features

- **Secure Execution**: Run Python code in a sandboxed WebAssembly environment
- **Package Management**: Automatically detects and installs required dependencies
- **Complete Results**: Captures standard output, standard error, and return values
- **Asynchronous Support**: Runs async code properly
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error reports for debugging

## Installation

Switch from npx to deno

We previously distributed `mcp-run-python` as an `npm` package to use via `npx`. We now recommend using `deno` instead as it provides better sandboxing and security.

The MCP Run Python server is distributed as a [JSR package](https://jsr.io/@pydantic/mcp-run-python) and can be run directly using [`deno run`](https://deno.com/):

terminal

```bash
deno run \
  -N -R=node_modules -W=node_modules --node-modules-dir=auto \
  jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python [stdio|streamable_http|sse|warmup]

```

where:

- `-N -R=node_modules -W=node_modules` (alias of `--allow-net --allow-read=node_modules --allow-write=node_modules`) allows network access and read+write access to `./node_modules`. These are required so Pyodide can download and cache the Python standard library and packages
- `--node-modules-dir=auto` tells deno to use a local `node_modules` directory
- `stdio` runs the server with the [Stdio MCP transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) â€” suitable for running the process as a subprocess locally
- `streamable_http` runs the server with the [Streamable HTTP MCP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) â€” running the server as an HTTP server to connect locally or remotely. This supports stateful requests, but does not require the client to hold a stateful connection like SSE
- `sse` runs the server with the [SSE MCP transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse) â€” running the server as an HTTP server to connect locally or remotely
- `warmup` will run a minimal Python script to download and cache the Python standard library. This is also useful to check the server is running correctly.

Usage of `jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python` with Pydantic AI is described in the [client](../client/#mcp-stdio-server) documentation.

## Direct Usage

As well as using this server with Pydantic AI, it can be connected to other MCP clients. For clarity, in this example we connect directly using the [Python MCP client](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

mcp_run_python.py

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

code = """
import numpy
a = numpy.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a)
a
"""
server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command='deno',
    args=[
        'run',
        '-N',
        '-R=node_modules',
        '-W=node_modules',
        '--node-modules-dir=auto',
        'jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python',
        'stdio',
    ],
)


async def main():
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            print(len(tools.tools))
            #> 1
            print(repr(tools.tools[0].name))
            #> 'run_python_code'
            print(repr(tools.tools[0].inputSchema))
            """
            {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'python_code': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Python code to run'}}, 'required': ['python_code'], 'additionalProperties': False, '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'}
            """
            result = await session.call_tool('run_python_code', {'python_code': code})
            print(result.content[0].text)
            """
            <status>success</status>
            <dependencies>["numpy"]</dependencies>
            <output>
            [1 2 3]
            </output>
            <return_value>
            [
              1,
              2,
              3
            ]
            </return_value>
            """

```

If an exception occurs, `status` will be `install-error` or `run-error` and `return_value` will be replaced by `error` which will include the traceback and exception message.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are installed when code is run.

Dependencies can be defined in one of two ways:

### Inferred from imports

If there's no metadata, dependencies are inferred from imports in the code, as shown in the example [above](#direct-usage).

### Inline script metadata

As introduced in PEP 723, explained [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata), and popularized by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies) â€” dependencies can be defined in a comment at the top of the file.

This allows use of dependencies that aren't imported in the code, and is more explicit.

inline_script_metadata.py

```py
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

# using `server_params` from the above example.
from mcp_run_python import server_params

code = """\
# /// script
# dependencies = ["pydantic", "email-validator"]
# ///
import pydantic

class Model(pydantic.BaseModel):
    email: pydantic.EmailStr

print(Model(email='hello@pydantic.dev'))
"""


async def main():
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool('run_python_code', {'python_code': code})
            print(result.content[0].text)
            """
            <status>success</status>
            <dependencies>["pydantic","email-validator"]</dependencies>
            <output>
            email='hello@pydantic.dev'
            </output>
            """

```

It also allows versions to be pinned for non-binary packages (Pyodide only supports a single version for the binary packages it supports, like `pydantic` and `numpy`).

E.g. you could set the dependencies to

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = ["rich<13"]
# ///

```

## Logging

MCP Run Python supports emitting stdout and stderr from the python execution as [MCP logging messages](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/eb4abdf2bb91e0d5afd94510741eadd416982350/docs/specification/draft/server/utilities/logging.md?plain=1).

For logs to be emitted you must set the logging level when connecting to the server. By default, the log level is set to the highest level, `emergency`.

Currently, it's not possible to demonstrate this due to a bug in the Python MCP Client, see [modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk#201](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/201#issuecomment-2727663121).

# Server

Pydantic AI models can also be used within MCP Servers.

## MCP Server

Here's a simple example of a [Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) using Pydantic AI within a tool call:

mcp_server.py

```py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

from pydantic_ai import Agent

server = FastMCP('Pydantic AI Server')
server_agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-latest', system_prompt='always reply in rhyme'
)


@server.tool()
async def poet(theme: str) -> str:
    """Poem generator"""
    r = await server_agent.run(f'write a poem about {theme}')
    return r.output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    server.run()

```

## Simple client

This server can be queried with any MCP client. Here is an example using the Python SDK directly:

mcp_client.py

```py
import asyncio
import os

from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client


async def client():
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command='python', args=['mcp_server.py'], env=os.environ
    )
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool('poet', {'theme': 'socks'})
            print(result.content[0].text)
            """
            Oh, socks, those garments soft and sweet,
            That nestle softly 'round our feet,
            From cotton, wool, or blended thread,
            They keep our toes from feeling dread.
            """


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(client())

```

## MCP Sampling

What is MCP Sampling?

See the [MCP client docs](../client/#mcp-sampling) for details of what MCP sampling is, and how you can support it when using Pydantic AI as an MCP client.

When Pydantic AI agents are used within MCP servers, they can use sampling via MCPSamplingModel.

We can extend the above example to use sampling so instead of connecting directly to the LLM, the agent calls back through the MCP client to make LLM calls.

mcp_server_sampling.py

```py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import Context, FastMCP

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.mcp_sampling import MCPSamplingModel

server = FastMCP('Pydantic AI Server with sampling')
server_agent = Agent(system_prompt='always reply in rhyme')


@server.tool()
async def poet(ctx: Context, theme: str) -> str:
    """Poem generator"""
    r = await server_agent.run(f'write a poem about {theme}', model=MCPSamplingModel(session=ctx.session))
    return r.output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    server.run()  # run the server over stdio

```

The [above](#simple-client) client does not support sampling, so if you tried to use it with this server you'd get an error.

The simplest way to support sampling in an MCP client is to [use](../client/#mcp-sampling) a Pydantic AI agent as the client, but if you wanted to support sampling with the vanilla MCP SDK, you could do so like this:

mcp_client_sampling.py

```py
import asyncio
from typing import Any

from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
from mcp.shared.context import RequestContext
from mcp.types import CreateMessageRequestParams, CreateMessageResult, ErrorData, TextContent


async def sampling_callback(
    context: RequestContext[ClientSession, Any], params: CreateMessageRequestParams
) -> CreateMessageResult | ErrorData:
    print('sampling system prompt:', params.systemPrompt)
    #> sampling system prompt: always reply in rhyme
    print('sampling messages:', params.messages)
    """
    sampling messages:
    [
        SamplingMessage(
            role='user',
            content=TextContent(
                type='text', text='write a poem about socks', annotations=None
            ),
        )
    ]
    """

    # TODO get the response content by calling an LLM...
    response_content = 'Socks for a fox.'

    return CreateMessageResult(
        role='assistant',
        content=TextContent(type='text', text=response_content),
        model='fictional-llm',
    )


async def client():
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(command='python', args=['mcp_server_sampling.py'])
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write, sampling_callback=sampling_callback) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool('poet', {'theme': 'socks'})
            print(result.content[0].text)
            #> Socks for a fox.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(client())

```

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+)*
# Optional

# Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Pydantic AI** comes with a CLI, `clai` (pronounced "clay") which you can use to interact with various LLMs from the command line. It provides a convenient way to chat with language models and quickly get answers right in the terminal.

We originally developed this CLI for our own use, but found ourselves using it so frequently that we decided to share it as part of the Pydantic AI package.

We plan to continue adding new features, such as interaction with MCP servers, access to tools, and more.

## Usage

You'll need to set an environment variable depending on the provider you intend to use.

E.g. if you're using OpenAI, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

```

Then with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/), run:

```bash
uvx clai

```

Or to install `clai` globally [with `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#installing-tools), run:

```bash
uv tool install clai
...
clai

```

Or with `pip`, run:

```bash
pip install clai
...
clai

```

Either way, running `clai` will start an interactive session where you can chat with the AI model. Special commands available in interactive mode:

- `/exit`: Exit the session
- `/markdown`: Show the last response in markdown format
- `/multiline`: Toggle multiline input mode (use Ctrl+D to submit)

### Help

To get help on the CLI, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
uvx clai --help

```

### Choose a model

You can specify which model to use with the `--model` flag:

```bash
uvx clai --model anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0

```

(a full list of models available can be printed with `uvx clai --list-models`)

### Custom Agents

You can specify a custom agent using the `--agent` flag with a module path and variable name:

custom_agent.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4.1', instructions='You always respond in Italian.')

```

Then run:

```bash
uvx clai --agent custom_agent:agent "What's the weather today?"

```

The format must be `module:variable` where:

- `module` is the importable Python module path
- `variable` is the name of the Agent instance in that module

Additionally, you can directly launch CLI mode from an `Agent` instance using `Agent.to_cli_sync()`:

agent_to_cli_sync.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4.1', instructions='You always respond in Italian.')
agent.to_cli_sync()

```

You can also use the async interface with `Agent.to_cli()`:

agent_to_cli.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4.1', instructions='You always respond in Italian.')

async def main():
    await agent.to_cli()

```

*(You'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)*

# Pydantic Logfire Debugging and Monitoring

Applications that use LLMs have some challenges that are well known and understood: LLMs are **slow**, **unreliable** and **expensive**.

These applications also have some challenges that most developers have encountered much less often: LLMs are **fickle** and **non-deterministic**. Subtle changes in a prompt can completely change a model's performance, and there's no `EXPLAIN` query you can run to understand why.

Warning

From a software engineers point of view, you can think of LLMs as the worst database you've ever heard of, but worse.

If LLMs weren't so bloody useful, we'd never touch them.

To build successful applications with LLMs, we need new tools to understand both model performance, and the behavior of applications that rely on them.

LLM Observability tools that just let you understand how your model is performing are useless: making API calls to an LLM is easy, it's building that into an application that's hard.

## Pydantic Logfire

[Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) is an observability platform developed by the team who created and maintain Pydantic Validation and Pydantic AI. Logfire aims to let you understand your entire application: Gen AI, classic predictive AI, HTTP traffic, database queries and everything else a modern application needs, all using OpenTelemetry.

Pydantic Logfire is a commercial product

Logfire is a commercially supported, hosted platform with an extremely generous and perpetual [free tier](https://pydantic.dev/pricing/). You can sign up and start using Logfire in a couple of minutes. Logfire can also be self-hosted on the enterprise tier.

Pydantic AI has built-in (but optional) support for Logfire. That means if the `logfire` package is installed and configured and agent instrumentation is enabled then detailed information about agent runs is sent to Logfire. Otherwise there's virtually no overhead and nothing is sent.

Here's an example showing details of running the [Weather Agent](../examples/weather-agent/) in Logfire:

A trace is generated for the agent run, and spans are emitted for each model request and tool call.

## Using Logfire

To use Logfire, you'll need a Logfire [account](https://logfire.pydantic.dev), and the Logfire Python SDK installed:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai[logfire]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai[logfire]"

```

Then authenticate your local environment with Logfire:

```bash
 logfire auth

```

```bash
uv run logfire auth

```

And configure a project to send data to:

```bash
 logfire projects new

```

```bash
uv run logfire projects new

```

(Or use an existing project with `logfire projects use`)

This will write to a `.logfire` directory in the current working directory, which the Logfire SDK will use for configuration at run time.

With that, you can start using Logfire to instrument Pydantic AI code:

instrument_pydantic_ai.py

```python
import logfire

from pydantic_ai import Agent

logfire.configure()  # (1)!
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()  # (2)!

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', instructions='Be concise, reply with one sentence.')
result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')  # (3)!
print(result.output)
"""
The first known use of "hello, world" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.
"""

```

1. logfire.configure() configures the SDK, by default it will find the write token from the `.logfire` directory, but you can also pass a token directly.
1. logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai() enables instrumentation of Pydantic AI.
1. Since we've enabled instrumentation, a trace will be generated for each run, with spans emitted for models calls and tool function execution

*(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")*

Which will display in Logfire thus:

The [Logfire documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/) has more details on how to use Logfire, including how to instrument other libraries like [HTTPX](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/http-clients/httpx/) and [FastAPI](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/web-frameworks/fastapi/).

Since Logfire is built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), you can use the Logfire Python SDK to send data to any OpenTelemetry collector, see [below](#using-opentelemetry).

### Debugging

To demonstrate how Logfire can let you visualise the flow of a Pydantic AI run, here's the view you get from Logfire while running the [chat app examples](../examples/chat-app/):

### Monitoring Performance

We can also query data with SQL in Logfire to monitor the performance of an application. Here's a real world example of using Logfire to monitor Pydantic AI runs inside Logfire itself:

### Monitoring HTTP Requests

"F\*\*k you, show me the prompt."

As per Hamel Husain's influential 2024 blog post ["Fuck You, Show Me The Prompt."](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/prompt/) (bear with the capitalization, the point is valid), it's often useful to be able to view the raw HTTP requests and responses made to model providers.

To observe raw HTTP requests made to model providers, you can use Logfire's [HTTPX instrumentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/integrations/http-clients/httpx/) since all provider SDKs use the [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) library internally.

with_logfire_instrument_httpx.py

```py
import logfire

from pydantic_ai import Agent

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

1. See the logfire.instrument_httpx docs more details, `capture_all=True` means both headers and body are captured for both the request and response.

without_logfire_instrument_httpx.py

```py
import logfire

from pydantic_ai import Agent

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

## Using OpenTelemetry

Pydantic AI's instrumentation uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTel), which Logfire is based on.

This means you can debug and monitor Pydantic AI with any OpenTelemetry backend.

Pydantic AI follows the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), so while we think you'll have the best experience using the Logfire platform , you should be able to use any OTel service with GenAI support.

### Logfire with an alternative OTel backend

You can use the Logfire SDK completely freely and send the data to any OpenTelemetry backend.

Here's an example of configuring the Logfire library to send data to the excellent [otel-tui](https://github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui) â€” an open source terminal based OTel backend and viewer (no association with Pydantic Validation).

Run `otel-tui` with docker (see [the otel-tui readme](https://github.com/ymtdzzz/otel-tui) for more instructions):

Terminal

docker run --rm -it -p 4318:4318 --name otel-tui ymtdzzz/otel-tui:latest

```

then run,

otel_tui.py

```python
import os

import logfire

from pydantic_ai import Agent

os.environ['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT'] = 'http://localhost:4318'  # (1)!
logfire.configure(send_to_logfire=False)  # (2)!
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

1. Set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the URL of your OpenTelemetry backend. If you're using a backend that requires authentication, you may need to set [other environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/). Of course, these can also be set outside the process, e.g. with `export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318`.
1. We configure Logfire to disable sending data to the Logfire OTel backend itself. If you removed `send_to_logfire=False`, data would be sent to both Logfire and your OpenTelemetry backend.

Running the above code will send tracing data to `otel-tui`, which will display like this:

Running the [weather agent](../examples/weather-agent/) example connected to `otel-tui` shows how it can be used to visualise a more complex trace:

For more information on using the Logfire SDK to send data to alternative backends, see [the Logfire documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/alternative-backends/).

### OTel without Logfire

You can also emit OpenTelemetry data from Pydantic AI without using Logfire at all.

To do this, you'll need to install and configure the OpenTelemetry packages you need. To run the following examples, use

Terminal

```text
uv run \
  --with 'pydantic-ai-slim[openai]' \
  --with opentelemetry-sdk \
  --with opentelemetry-exporter-otlp \
  raw_otel.py

```

raw_otel.py

```python
import os

from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.trace import set_tracer_provider

from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent

os.environ['OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT'] = 'http://localhost:4318'
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter()
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(exporter)
tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

Agent.instrument_all()
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

### Alternative Observability backends

Because Pydantic AI uses OpenTelemetry for observability, you can easily configure it to send data to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, not just our observability platform [Pydantic Logfire](#pydantic-logfire).

The following providers have dedicated documentation on Pydantic AI:

- [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/pydantic-ai)
- [W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/pydantic_ai/)
- [Arize](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/tracing-integrations-auto/pydantic-ai)
- [Openlayer](https://www.openlayer.com/docs/integrations/pydantic-ai)
- [OpenLIT](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/integrations/pydantic)
- [LangWatch](https://docs.langwatch.ai/integration/python/integrations/pydantic-ai)
- [Patronus AI](https://docs.patronus.ai/docs/percival/pydantic)
- [Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/integrations/pydantic-ai)
- [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/pydantic_ai)
- [Agenta](https://docs.agenta.ai/observability/integrations/pydanticai)

## Advanced usage

### Configuring data format

Pydantic AI follows the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), with one caveat. The semantic conventions specify that messages should be captured as individual events (logs) that are children of the request span. By default, Pydantic AI instead collects these events into a JSON array which is set as a single large attribute called `events` on the request span. To change this, use `event_mode='logs'`:

instrumentation_settings_event_mode.py

```python
import logfire

from pydantic_ai import Agent

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai(event_mode='logs')
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o')
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> Paris

```

For now, this won't look as good in the Logfire UI, but we're working on it.

If you have very long conversations, the `events` span attribute may be truncated. Using `event_mode='logs'` will help avoid this issue.

Note that the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are still experimental and are likely to change.

### Setting OpenTelemetry SDK providers

By default, the global `TracerProvider` and `EventLoggerProvider` are used. These are set automatically by `logfire.configure()`. They can also be set by the `set_tracer_provider` and `set_event_logger_provider` functions in the OpenTelemetry Python SDK. You can set custom providers with InstrumentationSettings.

instrumentation_settings_providers.py

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk._events import EventLoggerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider

from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent, InstrumentationSettings

instrumentation_settings = InstrumentationSettings(
    tracer_provider=TracerProvider(),
    event_logger_provider=EventLoggerProvider(),
)

agent = Agent('gpt-4o', instrument=instrumentation_settings)
# or to instrument all agents:
Agent.instrument_all(instrumentation_settings)

```

### Instrumenting a specific `Model`

instrumented_model_example.py

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.instrumented import InstrumentationSettings, InstrumentedModel

settings = InstrumentationSettings()
model = InstrumentedModel('gpt-4o', settings)
agent = Agent(model)

```

### Excluding binary content

excluding_binary_content.py

```python
from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent, InstrumentationSettings

instrumentation_settings = InstrumentationSettings(include_binary_content=False)

agent = Agent('gpt-4o', instrument=instrumentation_settings)
# or to instrument all agents:
Agent.instrument_all(instrumentation_settings)

```

### Excluding prompts and completions

For privacy and security reasons, you may want to monitor your agent's behavior and performance without exposing sensitive user data or proprietary prompts in your observability platform. Pydantic AI allows you to exclude the actual content from instrumentation events while preserving the structural information needed for debugging and monitoring.

When `include_content=False` is set, Pydantic AI will exclude sensitive content from OpenTelemetry events, including user prompts and model completions, tool call arguments and responses, and any other message content.

excluding_sensitive_content.py

```python
from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.instrumented import InstrumentationSettings

instrumentation_settings = InstrumentationSettings(include_content=False)

agent = Agent('gpt-4o', instrument=instrumentation_settings)
# or to instrument all agents:
Agent.instrument_all(instrumentation_settings)

```

This setting is particularly useful in production environments where compliance requirements or data sensitivity concerns make it necessary to limit what content is sent to your observability platform.

# Unit testing

Writing unit tests for Pydantic AI code is just like unit tests for any other Python code.

Because for the most part they're nothing new, we have pretty well established tools and patterns for writing and running these kinds of tests.

Unless you're really sure you know better, you'll probably want to follow roughly this strategy:

- Use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as your test harness
- If you find yourself typing out long assertions, use [inline-snapshot](https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot/latest/)
- Similarly, [dirty-equals](https://dirty-equals.helpmanual.io/latest/) can be useful for comparing large data structures
- Use TestModel or FunctionModel in place of your actual model to avoid the usage, latency and variability of real LLM calls
- Use Agent.override to replace an agent's model, dependencies, or toolsets inside your application logic
- Set ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS=False globally to block any requests from being made to non-test models accidentally

### Unit testing with `TestModel`

The simplest and fastest way to exercise most of your application code is using TestModel, this will (by default) call all tools in the agent, then return either plain text or a structured response depending on the return type of the agent.

`TestModel` is not magic

The "clever" (but not too clever) part of `TestModel` is that it will attempt to generate valid structured data for [function tools](../tools/) and [output types](../output/#structured-output) based on the schema of the registered tools.

There's no ML or AI in `TestModel`, it's just plain old procedural Python code that tries to generate data that satisfies the JSON schema of a tool.

The resulting data won't look pretty or relevant, but it should pass Pydantic's validation in most cases. If you want something more sophisticated, use FunctionModel and write your own data generation logic.

Let's write unit tests for the following application code:

weather_app.py

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import date

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext

from fake_database import DatabaseConn  # (1)!
from weather_service import WeatherService  # (2)!

weather_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=WeatherService,
    system_prompt='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
)


@weather_agent.tool
def weather_forecast(
    ctx: RunContext[WeatherService], location: str, forecast_date: date
) -> str:
    if forecast_date < date.today():  # (3)!
        return ctx.deps.get_historic_weather(location, forecast_date)
    else:
        return ctx.deps.get_forecast(location, forecast_date)


async def run_weather_forecast(  # (4)!
    user_prompts: list[tuple[str, int]], conn: DatabaseConn
):
    """Run weather forecast for a list of user prompts and save."""
    async with WeatherService() as weather_service:

        async def run_forecast(prompt: str, user_id: int):
            result = await weather_agent.run(prompt, deps=weather_service)
            await conn.store_forecast(user_id, result.output)

        # run all prompts in parallel
        await asyncio.gather(
            *(run_forecast(prompt, user_id) for (prompt, user_id) in user_prompts)
        )

```

1. `DatabaseConn` is a class that holds a database connection
1. `WeatherService` has methods to get weather forecasts and historic data about the weather
1. We need to call a different endpoint depending on whether the date is in the past or the future, you'll see why this nuance is important below
1. This function is the code we want to test, together with the agent it uses

Here we have a function that takes a list of `(user_prompt, user_id)` tuples, gets a weather forecast for each prompt, and stores the result in the database.

**We want to test this code without having to mock certain objects or modify our code so we can pass test objects in.**

Here's how we would write tests using TestModel:

test_weather_app.py

```python
from datetime import timezone
import pytest

from dirty_equals import IsNow, IsStr

from pydantic_ai import models, capture_run_messages
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelResponse,
    SystemPromptPart,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
    ToolReturnPart,
    UserPromptPart,
    ModelRequest,
)
from pydantic_ai.usage import Usage

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio  # (1)!
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False  # (2)!


async def test_forecast():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with capture_run_messages() as messages:
        with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):  # (3)!
            prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?'
            await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)  # (4)!

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == '{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}'  # (5)!

    assert messages == [  # (6)!
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                SystemPromptPart(
                    content='Providing a weather forecast at the locations the user provides.',
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
                ),
                UserPromptPart(
                    content='What will the weather be like in London on 2024-11-28?',
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),  # (7)!
                ),
            ]
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                ToolCallPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    args={
                        'location': 'a',
                        'forecast_date': '2024-01-01',  # (8)!
                    },
                    tool_call_id=IsStr(),
                )
            ],
            usage=Usage(
                requests=1,
                request_tokens=71,
                response_tokens=7,
                total_tokens=78,
                details=None,
            ),
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
        ModelRequest(
            parts=[
                ToolReturnPart(
                    tool_name='weather_forecast',
                    content='Sunny with a chance of rain',
                    tool_call_id=IsStr(),
                    timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
                ),
            ],
        ),
        ModelResponse(
            parts=[
                TextPart(
                    content='{"weather_forecast":"Sunny with a chance of rain"}',
                )
            ],
            usage=Usage(
                requests=1,
                request_tokens=77,
                response_tokens=16,
                total_tokens=93,
                details=None,
            ),
            model_name='test',
            timestamp=IsNow(tz=timezone.utc),
        ),
    ]

```

1. We're using [anyio](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run async tests.
1. This is a safety measure to make sure we don't accidentally make real requests to the LLM while testing, see ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS for more details.
1. We're using Agent.override to replace the agent's model with TestModel, the nice thing about `override` is that we can replace the model inside agent without needing access to the agent `run*` methods call site.
1. Now we call the function we want to test inside the `override` context manager.
1. But default, `TestModel` will return a JSON string summarising the tools calls made, and what was returned. If you wanted to customise the response to something more closely aligned with the domain, you could add custom_output_text='Sunny' when defining `TestModel`.
1. So far we don't actually know which tools were called and with which values, we can use capture_run_messages to inspect messages from the most recent run and assert the exchange between the agent and the model occurred as expected.
1. The IsNow helper allows us to use declarative asserts even with data which will contain timestamps that change over time.
1. `TestModel` isn't doing anything clever to extract values from the prompt, so these values are hardcoded.

### Unit testing with `FunctionModel`

The above tests are a great start, but careful readers will notice that the `WeatherService.get_forecast` is never called since `TestModel` calls `weather_forecast` with a date in the past.

To fully exercise `weather_forecast`, we need to use FunctionModel to customise how the tools is called.

Here's an example of using `FunctionModel` to test the `weather_forecast` tool with custom inputs

test_weather_app2.py

```python
import re

import pytest

from pydantic_ai import models
from pydantic_ai.messages import (
    ModelMessage,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    ToolCallPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel

from fake_database import DatabaseConn
from weather_app import run_weather_forecast, weather_agent

pytestmark = pytest.mark.anyio
models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False


def call_weather_forecast(  # (1)!
    messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo
) -> ModelResponse:
    if len(messages) == 1:
        # first call, call the weather forecast tool
        user_prompt = messages[0].parts[-1]
        m = re.search(r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}', user_prompt.content)
        assert m is not None
        args = {'location': 'London', 'forecast_date': m.group()}  # (2)!
        return ModelResponse(parts=[ToolCallPart('weather_forecast', args)])
    else:
        # second call, return the forecast
        msg = messages[-1].parts[0]
        assert msg.part_kind == 'tool-return'
        return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(f'The forecast is: {msg.content}')])


async def test_forecast_future():
    conn = DatabaseConn()
    user_id = 1
    with weather_agent.override(model=FunctionModel(call_weather_forecast)):  # (3)!
        prompt = 'What will the weather be like in London on 2032-01-01?'
        await run_weather_forecast([(prompt, user_id)], conn)

    forecast = await conn.get_forecast(user_id)
    assert forecast == 'The forecast is: Rainy with a chance of sun'

```

1. We define a function `call_weather_forecast` that will be called by `FunctionModel` in place of the LLM, this function has access to the list of ModelMessages that make up the run, and AgentInfo which contains information about the agent and the function tools and return tools.
1. Our function is slightly intelligent in that it tries to extract a date from the prompt, but just hard codes the location.
1. We use FunctionModel to replace the agent's model with our custom function.

### Overriding model via pytest fixtures

If you're writing lots of tests that all require model to be overridden, you can use [pytest fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html) to override the model with TestModel or FunctionModel in a reusable way.

Here's an example of a fixture that overrides the model with `TestModel`:

test_agent.py

```python
import pytest
from weather_app import weather_agent

from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel


@pytest.fixture
def override_weather_agent():
    with weather_agent.override(model=TestModel()):
        yield


async def test_forecast(override_weather_agent: None):
    ...
    # test code here

```

# Examples

Examples of how to use Pydantic AI and what it can do.

## Usage

These examples are distributed with `pydantic-ai` so you can run them either by cloning the [pydantic-ai repo](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) or by simply installing `pydantic-ai` from PyPI with `pip` or `uv`.

### Installing required dependencies

Either way you'll need to install extra dependencies to run some examples, you just need to install the `examples` optional dependency group.

If you've installed `pydantic-ai` via pip/uv, you can install the extra dependencies with:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai[examples]"

```

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai[examples]"

```

If you clone the repo, you should instead use `uv sync --extra examples` to install extra dependencies.

### Setting model environment variables

These examples will need you to set up authentication with one or more of the LLMs, see the [model configuration](../models/) docs for details on how to do this.

TL;DR: in most cases you'll need to set one of the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

```

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key

```

### Running Examples

To run the examples (this will work whether you installed `pydantic_ai`, or cloned the repo), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.<example_module_name>

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.<example_module_name>

```

For examples, to run the very simple [`pydantic_model`](pydantic-model/) example:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

If you like one-liners and you're using uv, you can run a pydantic-ai example with zero setup:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key' \
  uv run --with "pydantic-ai[examples]" \
  -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

______________________________________________________________________

You'll probably want to edit examples in addition to just running them. You can copy the examples to a new directory with:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples --copy-to examples/

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples --copy-to examples/

```

# Agent User Interaction (AG-UI)

Example of using Pydantic AI agents with the [AG-UI Dojo](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/typescript-sdk/apps/dojo) example app.

See the [AG-UI docs](../../ag-ui/) for more information about the AG-UI integration.

Demonstrates:

- [AG-UI](../../ag-ui/)
- [Tools](../../tools/)

## Prerequisites

- An [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)

## Running the Example

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage) you will need two command line windows.

### Pydantic AI AG-UI backend

Setup your OpenAI API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>

```

Start the Pydantic AI AG-UI example backend.

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.ag_ui

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.ag_ui

```

### AG-UI Dojo example frontend

Next run the AG-UI Dojo example frontend.

1. Clone the [AG-UI repository](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui)

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git

   ```

1. Change into to the `ag-ui/typescript-sdk` directory

   ```shell
   cd ag-ui/typescript-sdk

   ```

1. Run the Dojo app following the [official instructions](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/typescript-sdk/apps/dojo#development-setup)

1. Visit <http://localhost:3000/pydantic-ai>

1. Select View `Pydantic AI` from the sidebar

## Feature Examples

### Agentic Chat

This demonstrates a basic agent interaction including Pydantic AI server side tools and AG-UI client side tools.

View the [Agentic Chat example](http://localhost:3000/pydantic-ai/feature/agentic_chat).

#### Agent Tools

- `time` - Pydantic AI tool to check the current time for a time zone
- `background` - AG-UI tool to set the background color of the client window

#### Agent Prompts

```text
What is the time in New York?

```

```text
Change the background to blue

```

A complex example which mixes both AG-UI and Pydantic AI tools:

```text
Perform the following steps, waiting for the response of each step before continuing:
1. Get the time
2. Set the background to red
3. Get the time
4. Report how long the background set took by diffing the two times

```

# Chat App with FastAPI

Simple chat app example build with FastAPI.

Demonstrates:

- [reusing chat history](../../message-history/)
- [serializing messages](../../message-history/#accessing-messages-from-results)
- [streaming responses](../../output/#streamed-results)

This demonstrates storing chat history between requests and using it to give the model context for new responses.

Most of the complex logic here is between `chat_app.py` which streams the response to the browser, and `chat_app.ts` which renders messages in the browser.

## Running the Example

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.chat_app

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.chat_app

```

Then open the app at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Example Code

Python code that runs the chat app:

[chat_app.py](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/chat_app.py)

Example of a multi-agent flow where one agent delegates work to another, then hands off control to a third agent.

Demonstrates:

- [agent delegation](../../multi-agent-applications/#agent-delegation)
- [programmatic agent hand-off](../../multi-agent-applications/#programmatic-agent-hand-off)
- [usage limits](../../agents/#usage-limits)

In this scenario, a group of agents work together to find the best flight for a user.

The control flow for this example can be summarised as follows:

```
graph TD
  START --> search_agent("search agent")
  search_agent --> extraction_agent("extraction agent")
  extraction_agent --> search_agent
  search_agent --> human_confirm("human confirm")
  human_confirm --> search_agent
  search_agent --> FAILED
  human_confirm --> find_seat_function("find seat function")
  find_seat_function --> human_seat_choice("human seat choice")
  human_seat_choice --> find_seat_agent("find seat agent")
  find_seat_agent --> find_seat_function
  find_seat_function --> buy_flights("buy flights")
  buy_flights --> SUCCESS
```

## Running the Example

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.flight_booking

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.flight_booking

# Pydantic Model

Simple example of using Pydantic AI to construct a Pydantic model from a text input.

Demonstrates:

- [structured `output_type`](../../output/#structured-output)

## Running the Example

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

This examples uses `openai:gpt-4o` by default, but it works well with other models, e.g. you can run it with Gemini using:

```bash
PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro python -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

```bash
PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.pydantic_model

```

# RAG

RAG search example. This demo allows you to ask question of the [logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) documentation.

Demonstrates:

- [tools](../../tools/)
- [agent dependencies](../../dependencies/)
- RAG search

This is done by creating a database containing each section of the markdown documentation, then registering the search tool with the Pydantic AI agent.

Logic for extracting sections from markdown files and a JSON file with that data is available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/samuelcolvin/4b5bb9bb163b1122ff17e29e48c10992).

[PostgreSQL with pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is used as the search database, the easiest way to download and run pgvector is using Docker:

```bash
mkdir postgres-data
docker run --rm \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 54320:5432 \
  -v `pwd`/postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg17

```

As with the [SQL gen](../sql-gen/) example, we run postgres on port `54320` to avoid conflicts with any other postgres instances you may have running. We also mount the PostgreSQL `data` directory locally to persist the data if you need to stop and restart the container.

With that running and [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), we can build the search database with (**WARNING**: this requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable and will calling the OpenAI embedding API around 300 times to generate embeddings for each section of the documentation):

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.rag build

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.rag build

```

(Note building the database doesn't use Pydantic AI right now, instead it uses the OpenAI SDK directly.)

You can then ask the agent a question with:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.rag search "How do I configure logfire to work with FastAPI?"

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.rag search "How do I configure logfire to work with FastAPI?"

```

## Example Code

        -v `pwd`/postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \

# Slack Lead Qualifier with Modal

In this example, we're going to build an agentic app that:

- automatically researches each new member that joins a company's public Slack community to see how good of a fit they are for the company's commercial product,
- sends this analysis into a (private) Slack channel, and
- sends a daily summary of the top 5 leads from the previous 24 hours into a (different) Slack channel.

We'll be deploying the app on [Modal](https://modal.com), as it lets you use Python to define an app with web endpoints, scheduled functions, and background functions, and deploy them with a CLI, without needing to set up or manage any infrastructure. It's a great way to lower the barrier for people in your organization to start building and deploying AI agents to make their jobs easier.

We also add [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) to get observability into the app and agent as they're running in response to webhooks and the schedule

## Screenshots

This is what the analysis sent into Slack will look like:

This is what the corresponding trace in [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) will look like:

All of these entries can be clicked on to get more details about what happened at that step, including the full conversation with the LLM and HTTP requests and responses.

## Prerequisites

If you just want to see the code without actually going through the effort of setting up the bits necessary to run it, feel free to [jump ahead](#the-code).

### Slack app

You need to have a Slack workspace and the necessary permissions to create apps.

2. Create a new Slack app using the instructions at <https://docs.slack.dev/quickstart>.

   1. In step 2, "Requesting scopes", request the following scopes:
      - [`users.read`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/users.read)
      - [`users.read.email`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/users.read.email)
      - [`users.profile.read`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/scopes/users.profile.read)
   1. In step 3, "Installing and authorizing the app", note down the Access Token as we're going to need to store it as a Secret in Modal.
   1. You can skip steps 4 and 5. We're going to need to subscribe to the `team_join` event, but at this point you don't have a webhook URL yet.

1. Create the channels the app will post into, and add the Slack app to them:

   - `#new-slack-leads`
   - `#daily-slack-leads-summary`

   These names are hard-coded in the example. If you want to use different channels, you can clone the repo and change them in `examples/pydantic_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/functions.py`.

### Logfire Write Token

1. If you don't have a Logfire account yet, create one on <https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/>.
1. Create a new project named, for example, `slack-lead-qualifier`.
1. Generate a new Write Token and note it down, as we're going to need to store it as a Secret in Modal.

### OpenAI API Key

1. If you don't have an OpenAI account yet, create one on <https://platform.openai.com/>.
1. Create a new API Key in Settings and note it down, as we're going to need to store it as a Secret in Modal.

### Modal account

1. If you don't have a Modal account yet, create one on <https://modal.com/signup>.
1. Create 3 Secrets of type "Custom" on <https://modal.com/secrets>:
   - Name: `slack`, key: `SLACK_API_KEY`, value: the Slack Access Token you generated earlier
   - Name: `logfire`, key: `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`, value: the Logfire Write Token you generated earlier
   - Name: `openai`, key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, value: the OpenAI API Key you generated earlier

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the [dependencies installed](../#usage).

1. Authenticate with Modal:

   ```bash
   python/uv-run -m modal setup

   ```

1. Run the example as an [ephemeral Modal app](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps#ephemeral-apps), meaning it will only run until you quit it using Ctrl+C:

   ```bash
   python/uv-run -m modal serve -m pydantic_ai_examples.slack_lead_qualifier.modal

   ```

1. Note down the URL after `Created web function web_app =>`, this is your webhook endpoint URL.

1. Go back to <https://docs.slack.dev/quickstart> and follow step 4, "Configuring the app for event listening", to subscribe to the `team_join` event with the webhook endpoint URL you noted down as the Request URL.

Now when someone new (possibly you with a throwaway email) joins the Slack workspace, you'll see the webhook event being processed in the terminal where you ran `modal serve` and in the Logfire Live view, and after waiting a few seconds you should see the result appear in the `#new-slack-leads` Slack channel!

Faking a Slack signup

You can also fake a Slack signup event and try out the agent like this, with any name or email you please:

```bash
curl -X POST <webhook endpoint URL> \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "type": "event_callback",
    "event": {
        "type": "team_join",
        "user": {
            "profile": {
                "email": "samuel@pydantic.dev",
                "first_name": "Samuel",
                "last_name": "Colvin",
                "display_name": "Samuel Colvin"
            }
        }
    }
}'

```

Deploying to production

If you'd like to deploy this app into your Modal workspace in a persistent fashion, you can use this command:

```bash
python/uv-run -m modal deploy -m pydantic_ai_examples.slack_lead_qualifier.modal

```

You'll likely want to [download the code](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier) first, put it in a new repo, and then do [continuous deployment](https://modal.com/docs/guide/continuous-deployment#github-actions) using GitHub Actions.

Don't forget to update the Slack event request URL to the new persistent URL! You'll also want to modify the [instructions for the agent](#agent) to your own situation.

## The code

We're going to start with the basics, and then gradually build up into the full app.

### Models

#### `Profile`

First, we define a [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) model that represents a Slack user profile. These are the fields we get from the [`team_join`](https://docs.slack.dev/reference/events/team_join) event that's sent to the webhook endpoint that we'll define in a bit.

[slack_lead_qualifier/models.py (L11-L15)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/models.py#L11-L15)

```py
...

class Profile(BaseModel):
    first_name: str | None = None
    last_name: str | None = None
    display_name: str | None = None
    email: str

...

```

We also define a `Profile.as_prompt()` helper method that uses format_as_xml to turn the profile into a string that can be sent to the model.

[slack_lead_qualifier/models.py (L7-L19)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/models.py#L7-L19)

```py
...

from pydantic_ai import format_as_xml

...

class Profile(BaseModel):

...

    def as_prompt(self) -> str:
        return format_as_xml(self, root_tag='profile')

...

```

#### `Analysis`

The second model we'll need represents the result of the analysis that the agent will perform. We include docstrings to provide additional context to the model on what these fields should contain.

[slack_lead_qualifier/models.py (L23-L31)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/models.py#L23-L31)

```py
...

class Analysis(BaseModel):
    profile: Profile
    organization_name: str
    organization_domain: str
    job_title: str
    relevance: Annotated[int, Ge(1), Le(5)]
    """Estimated fit for Pydantic Logfire: 1 = low, 5 = high"""
    summary: str
    """One-sentence welcome note summarising who they are and how we might help"""

...

```

We also define a `Analysis.as_slack_blocks()` helper method that turns the analysis into some [Slack blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) that can be sent to the Slack API to post a new message.

[slack_lead_qualifier/models.py (L23-L46)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/models.py#L23-L46)

```py
...

class Analysis(BaseModel):

...

    def as_slack_blocks(self, include_relevance: bool = False) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        profile = self.profile
        relevance = f'({self.relevance}/5)' if include_relevance else ''
        return [
            {
                'type': 'markdown',
                'text': f'[{profile.display_name}](mailto:{profile.email}), {self.job_title} at [**{self.organization_name}**](https://{self.organization_domain}) {relevance}',
            },
            {
                'type': 'markdown',
                'text': self.summary,
            },
        ]

```

### Agent

Now it's time to get into Pydantic AI and define the agent that will do the actual analysis!

We specify the model we'll use (`openai:gpt-4o`), provide [instructions](../../agents/#instructions), give the agent access to the [DuckDuckGo search tool](../../common-tools/#duckduckgo-search-tool), and tell it to output either an `Analysis` or `None` using the [Native Output](../../output/#native-output) structured output mode.

The real meat of the app is in the instructions that tell the agent how to evaluate each new Slack member. If you plan to use this app yourself, you'll of course want to modify them to your own situation.

[slack_lead_qualifier/agent.py (L7-L40)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/agent.py#L7-L40)

```py
...

from pydantic_ai import Agent, NativeOutput
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool

...

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    instructions=dedent(
        """
        When a new person joins our public Slack, please put together a brief snapshot so we can be most useful to them.

        **What to include**

        1. **Who they are:**  Any details about their professional role or projects (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, company bio).
        2. **Where they work:**  Name of the organisation and its domain.
        3. **How we can help:**  On a scale of 1â€“5, estimate how likely they are to benefit from **Pydantic Logfire**
           (our paid observability tool) based on factors such as company size, product maturity, or AI usage.

        """
    ),
    tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],
    output_type=NativeOutput([Analysis, NoneType]),
)

...

```

#### `analyze_profile`

We also define a `analyze_profile` helper function that takes a `Profile`, runs the agent, and returns an `Analysis` (or `None`), and instrument it using [Logfire](../../logfire/).

[slack_lead_qualifier/agent.py (L44-L47)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/agent.py#L44-L47)

```py
...

@logfire.instrument('Analyze profile')
async def analyze_profile(profile: Profile) -> Analysis | None:
    result = await agent.run(profile.as_prompt())
    return result.output

```

### Analysis store

The next building block we'll need is a place to store all the analyses that have been done so that we can look them up when we send the daily summary.

Fortunately, Modal provides us with a convenient way to store some data that can be read back in a subsequent Modal run (webhook or scheduled): [`modal.Dict`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Dict).

We define some convenience methods to easily add, list, and clear analyses.

[slack_lead_qualifier/store.py (L4-L31)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/store.py#L4-L31)

```py
...

import modal

...

class AnalysisStore:
    @classmethod
    @logfire.instrument('Add analysis to store')
    async def add(cls, analysis: Analysis):
        await cls._get_store().put.aio(analysis.profile.email, analysis.model_dump())

    @classmethod
    @logfire.instrument('List analyses from store')
    async def list(cls) -> list[Analysis]:
        return [
            Analysis.model_validate(analysis)
            async for analysis in cls._get_store().values.aio()
        ]

    @classmethod
    @logfire.instrument('Clear analyses from store')
    async def clear(cls):
        await cls._get_store().clear.aio()

    @classmethod
    def _get_store(cls) -> modal.Dict:
        return modal.Dict.from_name('analyses', create_if_missing=True)  # type: ignore

```

Note

Note that `# type: ignore` on the last line -- unfortunately `modal` does not fully define its types, so we need this to stop our static type checker `pyright`, which we run over all Pydantic AI code including examples, from complaining.

### Send Slack message

Next, we'll need a way to actually send a Slack message, so we define a simple function that uses Slack's [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API.

[slack_lead_qualifier/slack.py (L8-L30)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/slack.py#L8-L30)

```py
...

API_KEY = os.getenv('SLACK_API_KEY')
assert API_KEY, 'SLACK_API_KEY is not set'


@logfire.instrument('Send Slack message')
async def send_slack_message(channel: str, blocks: list[dict[str, Any]]):
    client = httpx.AsyncClient()
    response = await client.post(
        'https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage',
        json={
            'channel': channel,
            'blocks': blocks,
        },
        headers={
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}',
        },
        timeout=5,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    result = response.json()
    if not result.get('ok', False):
        error = result.get('error', 'Unknown error')
        raise Exception(f'Failed to send to Slack: {error}')

```

### Features

Now we can start putting these building blocks together to implement the actual features we want!

#### `process_slack_member`

This function takes a [`Profile`](#profile), [analyzes](#analyze_profile) it using the agent, adds it to the [`AnalysisStore`](#analysis-store), and [sends](#send-slack-message) the analysis into the `#new-slack-leads` channel.

[slack_lead_qualifier/functions.py (L4-L45)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/functions.py#L4-L45)

```py
...

from .agent import analyze_profile
from .models import Profile

from .slack import send_slack_message
from .store import AnalysisStore

...

NEW_LEAD_CHANNEL = '#new-slack-leads'

...

@logfire.instrument('Process Slack member')
async def process_slack_member(profile: Profile):
    analysis = await analyze_profile(profile)
    logfire.info('Analysis', analysis=analysis)

    if analysis is None:
        return

    await AnalysisStore().add(analysis)

    await send_slack_message(
        NEW_LEAD_CHANNEL,
        [
            {
                'type': 'header',
                'text': {
                    'type': 'plain_text',
                    'text': f'New Slack member with score {analysis.relevance}/5',
                },
            },
            {
                'type': 'divider',
            },
            *analysis.as_slack_blocks(),
        ],
    )

...

```

#### `send_daily_summary`

This function list all of the analyses in the [`AnalysisStore`](#analysis-store), takes the top 5 by relevance, [sends](#send-slack-message) them into the `#daily-slack-leads-summary` channel, and clears the `AnalysisStore` so that the next daily run won't process these analyses again.

[slack_lead_qualifier/functions.py (L8-L85)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/functions.py#L8-L85)

```py
...

from .slack import send_slack_message
from .store import AnalysisStore

...

DAILY_SUMMARY_CHANNEL = '#daily-slack-leads-summary'

...

@logfire.instrument('Send daily summary')
async def send_daily_summary():
    analyses = await AnalysisStore().list()
    logfire.info('Analyses', analyses=analyses)

    if len(analyses) == 0:
        return

    sorted_analyses = sorted(analyses, key=lambda x: x.relevance, reverse=True)
    top_analyses = sorted_analyses[:5]

    blocks = [
        {
            'type': 'header',
            'text': {
                'type': 'plain_text',
                'text': f'Top {len(top_analyses)} new Slack members from the last 24 hours',
            },
        },
    ]

    for analysis in top_analyses:
        blocks.extend(
            [
                {
                    'type': 'divider',
                },
                *analysis.as_slack_blocks(include_relevance=True),
            ]
        )

    await send_slack_message(
        DAILY_SUMMARY_CHANNEL,
        blocks,
    )

    await AnalysisStore().clear()

```

### Web app

As it stands, neither of these functions are actually being called from anywhere.

Let's implement a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) endpoint to handle the `team_join` Slack webhook (also known as the [Slack Events API](https://docs.slack.dev/apis/events-api)) and call the [`process_slack_member`](#process_slack_member) function we just defined. We also instrument FastAPI using Logfire for good measure.

[slack_lead_qualifier/app.py (L20-L36)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/app.py#L20-L36)

```py
...

app = FastAPI()
logfire.instrument_fastapi(app, capture_headers=True)


@app.post('/')
async def process_webhook(payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    if payload['type'] == 'url_verification':
        return {'challenge': payload['challenge']}
    elif (
        payload['type'] == 'event_callback' and payload['event']['type'] == 'team_join'
    ):
        profile = Profile.model_validate(payload['event']['user']['profile'])

        process_slack_member(profile)
        return {'status': 'OK'}

    raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)

```

#### `process_slack_member` with Modal

I was a little sneaky there -- we're not actually calling the [`process_slack_member`](#process_slack_member) function we defined in `functions.py` directly, as Slack requires webhooks to respond within 3 seconds, and we need a bit more time than that to talk to the LLM, do some web searches, and send the Slack message.

Instead, we're calling the following function defined alongside the app, which uses Modal's [`modal.Function.spawn`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Function#spawn) feature to run a function in the background. (If you're curious what the Modal side of this function looks like, you can [jump ahead](#backgrounded-process_slack_member).)

Because `modal.py` (which we'll see in the next section) imports `app.py`, we import from `modal.py` inside the function definition because doing so at the top level would have resulted in a circular import error.

We also pass along the current Logfire context to get [Distributed Tracing](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/distributed-tracing/), meaning that the background function execution will show up nested under the webhook request trace, so that we have everything related to that request in one place.

[slack_lead_qualifier/app.py (L11-L16)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/app.py#L11-L16)

```py
...

def process_slack_member(profile: Profile):
    from .modal import process_slack_member as _process_slack_member

    _process_slack_member.spawn(
        profile.model_dump(), logfire_ctx=get_context()
    )

...

```

### Modal app

Now let's see how easy Modal makes it to deploy all of this.

#### Set up Modal

The first thing we do is define the Modal app, by specifying the base image to use (Debian with Python 3.13), all the Python packages it needs, and all of the secrets defined in the Modal interface that need to be made available during runtime.

[slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py (L4-L21)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py#L4-L21)

```py
...

import modal

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version='3.13').pip_install(
    'pydantic',
    'pydantic_ai_slim[openai,duckduckgo]',
    'logfire[httpx,fastapi]',
    'fastapi[standard]',
    'httpx',
)
app = modal.App(
    name='slack-lead-qualifier',
    image=image,
    secrets=[
        modal.Secret.from_name('logfire'),
        modal.Secret.from_name('openai'),
        modal.Secret.from_name('slack'),
    ],
)

...

```

#### Set up Logfire

Next, we define a function to set up Logfire instrumentation for Pydantic AI and HTTPX.

We cannot do this at the top level of the file, as the requested packages (like `logfire`) will only be available within functions running on Modal (like the ones we'll define next). This file, `modal.py`, runs on your local machine and only has access to the `modal` package.

[slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py (L25-L30)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py#L25-L30)

```py
...

def setup_logfire():
    import logfire

    logfire.configure(service_name=app.name)
    logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
    logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)

...

```

#### Web app

To deploy a [web endpoint](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks) on Modal, we simply define a function that returns an ASGI app (like FastAPI) and decorate it with `@app.function()` and `@modal.asgi_app()`.

This `web_app` function will be run on Modal, so inside the function we can call the `setup_logfire` function that requires the `logfire` package, and import `app.py` which uses the other requested packages.

By default, Modal spins up a container to handle a function call (like a web request) on-demand, meaning there's a little bit of startup time to each request. However, Slack requires webhooks to respond within 3 seconds, so we specify `min_containers=1` to keep the web endpoint running and ready to answer requests at all times. This is a bit annoying and wasteful, but fortunately [Modal's pricing](https://modal.com/pricing) is pretty reasonable, you get $30 free monthly compute, and they offer up to $50k in free credits for startup and academic researchers.

[slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py (L34-L41)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py#L34-L41)

```py
...

@app.function(min_containers=1)
@modal.asgi_app()  # type: ignore
def web_app():
    setup_logfire()

    from .app import app as _app

    return _app

...

```

Note

Note that `# type: ignore` on the `@modal.asgi_app()` line -- unfortunately `modal` does not fully define its types, so we need this to stop our static type checker `pyright`, which we run over all Pydantic AI code including examples, from complaining.

#### Scheduled `send_daily_summary`

To define a [scheduled function](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cron), we can use the `@app.function()` decorator with a `schedule` argument. This Modal function will call our imported [`send_daily_summary`](#send_daily_summary) function every day at 8 am UTC.

[slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py (L60-L66)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py#L60-L66)

```py
...

@app.function(schedule=modal.Cron('0 8 * * *'))  # Every day at 8am UTC
async def send_daily_summary():
    setup_logfire()

    from .functions import send_daily_summary as _send_daily_summary

    await _send_daily_summary()

```

#### Backgrounded `process_slack_member`

Finally, we define a Modal function that wraps our [`process_slack_member`](#process_slack_member) function, so that it can run in the background.

As you'll remember from when we [spawned this function from the web app](#process_slack_member-with-modal), we passed along the Logfire context to get [Distributed Tracing](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/how-to-guides/distributed-tracing/), so we need to attach it here.

[slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py (L45-L56)](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/slack_lead_qualifier/modal.py#L45-L56)

```py
...

@app.function()
async def process_slack_member(profile_raw: dict[str, Any], logfire_ctx: Any):
    setup_logfire()

    from logfire.propagate import attach_context

    from .functions import process_slack_member as _process_slack_member
    from .models import Profile

    with attach_context(logfire_ctx):
        profile = Profile.model_validate(profile_raw)
        await _process_slack_member(profile)

...

```

## Conclusion

And that's it! Now, assuming you've met the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), you can run or deploy the app using the commands under [usage](#usage).

# SQL Generation

Example demonstrating how to use Pydantic AI to generate SQL queries based on user input.

Demonstrates:

- [dynamic system prompt](../../agents/#system-prompts)
- [structured `output_type`](../../output/#structured-output)
- [output validation](../../output/#output-validator-functions)
- [agent dependencies](../../dependencies/)

## Running the Example

The resulting SQL is validated by running it as an `EXPLAIN` query on PostgreSQL. To run the example, you first need to run PostgreSQL, e.g. via Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 54320:5432 postgres

```

*(we run postgres on port `54320` to avoid conflicts with any other postgres instances you may have running)*

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.sql_gen

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.sql_gen

```

or to use a custom prompt:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.sql_gen "find me errors"

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.sql_gen "find me errors"

```

This model uses `gemini-1.5-flash` by default since Gemini is good at single shot queries of this kind.

## Example Code

[sql_gen.py](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/examples/pydantic_ai_examples/sql_gen.py)

```py

Example of Pydantic AI with multiple tools which the LLM needs to call in turn to answer a question.

Demonstrates:

- [tools](../../tools/)
- [agent dependencies](../../dependencies/)
- [streaming text responses](../../output/#streaming-text)
- Building a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) UI for the agent

In this case the idea is a "weather" agent â€” the user can ask for the weather in multiple locations, the agent will use the `get_lat_lng` tool to get the latitude and longitude of the locations, then use the `get_weather` tool to get the weather for those locations.

## Running the Example

To run this example properly, you might want to add two extra API keys **(Note if either key is missing, the code will fall back to dummy data, so they're not required)**:

- A weather API key from [tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/) set via `WEATHER_API_KEY`
- A geocoding API key from [geocode.maps.co](https://geocode.maps.co/) set via `GEO_API_KEY`

With [dependencies installed and environment variables set](../#usage), run:

```bash
python -m pydantic_ai_examples.weather_agent

```

```bash
uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.weather_agent

```

## Running the UI

You can build multi-turn chat applications for your agent with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), a framework for building AI web applications entirely in python. Gradio comes with built-in chat components and agent support so the entire UI will be implemented in a single python file!

Here's what the UI looks like for the weather agent:

Note, to run the UI, you'll need Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install gradio>=5.9.0
python/uv-run -m pydantic_ai_examples.weather_agent_gradio

```
